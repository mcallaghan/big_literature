      "Six phenological models, two simple forcing (F)-models and one sequential chilling/forcing (CF)-model, each with and without day length (DL)-term in the forcing approach were optimised (2001-2010) and validated (2011-2015) on very accurate blossoming data of an experimental sweet cherry orchard at Berlin-Dahlem (cultivar 'Summit'). In parallel, in 3 seasons (2011/2012-2013/2014) climate chamber experiments were performed in order to determine the end of dormancy for 'Summit', which is usually an unknown or uncertain parameter in phenological modelling. Additionally, in the season 2013/2014 an in situ climate change experiment on three trees in the sweet cherry orchard were arranged, which was used to validate the phenological models for distinctly warmer climate conditions at the experimental site. On the basis of our climate chamber experiments we quantified the chilling requirement of 'Summit' trees. Thus, we were able to identify a CF -model for the beginning of sweet cherry blossom which is mostly physiologically based and works well for current and for future climate conditions at the experimental site. This paper also shows how phenological models can fail under warmer climates, if either the model is too simple or the model parameters are wrong. Additional, we confirmed that phenological models with DL -term in the forcing approach clearly surpassed the conventional phenological models without this parameter. The reason for this behaviour is extensively discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane to higher hydrocarbons (OCM) as an alternative route to ethylene or liquid fuels obtained much attention. Besides the intensive research and novel developments in the catalyst field are a number of investigations conducted with reaction and separation engineering aspects at the TU Berlin. The aim of this research is the demonstration of the technical feasibility of the OCM process, including product recovery in a miniplant scale. In this article the gas treatment of the reaction product gas is discussed as a key part of the production chain from raw material to the product. In the OCM process the CO2 is treated as an unwanted by-product or waste. Nevertheless, the energy and the costs requirements for the whole OCM process are crucial for industrial applicability and must be kept as low as possible to operate economically. Therefore different separation methods are examined and several process alternatives are investigated. In this article the energy saving of a hybrid separation process based on a membrane-absorption process for the CO2 capture of the OCM process is presented and proved experimentally in miniplant scale. In a case study of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) process the development of an integrated gas treatment process for CO2 capture in the miniplant scale is presented and experimental results are discussed.

      "The purpose of this study is to investigate horizontal transport processes in the winter stratosphere using data with a resolution relevant for chemistry and climate modeling. For this reason the Freie Universitat Berlin Climate Middle Atmosphere Model (FUB-CMAM) with its model top at 83 km altitude, increased horizontal resolution T42 and the semi-Lagrangian transport scheme for advecting passive tracers is used.A new approach of this paper is the classification of specific transport phenomena within the stratosphere into tropical-subtropical streamers (e.g. Offermann et al., 1999) and polar vortex extrusions hereafter called polar vortex streamers. To investigate the role played by these large-scale structures on the inter-annual and seasonal variability of transport processes in northern mid-latitudes, the global occurrence of such streamers was calculated based on a 10-year model climatology, concentrating on the existence of the Arctic polar vortex. For the identification and counting of streamers, the new method of zonal anomaly was chosen. The analysis of the months October-May yielded a maximum occurrence of tropical-subtropical streamers during Arctic winter and spring in the middle and upper stratosphere. Synoptic maps revealed highest intensities in the subtropics over East Asia with a secondary maximum over the Atlantic in the northern hemisphere. Furthermore, tropical-subtropical streamers exhibited a higher occurrence than polar vortex streamers, indicating that the subtropical barrier is more permeable than the polar vortex barrier (edge) in the model, which is in good correspondence with observations (e. g. Plumb, 2002; Neu et al., 2003). Interesting for the total ozone decrease in mid-latitudes is the consideration of the lower stratosphere for tropical-subtropical streamers and the stratosphere above similar to20 km altitude for polar vortex streamers, where strongest ozone depletion is observed at polar latitudes (WMO, 2003). In the lower stratosphere the FUB-CMAM simulated a climatological maximum of 10% occurrence of tropical-subtropical streamers over East-Asia/West Pacific and the Atlantic during early-and mid-winter.The results of this paper demonstrate that stratospheric streamers e. g. large-scale, tongue-like structures transporting tropical-subtropical and polar vortex air masses into mid-latitudes occur frequently during Arctic winter. They can therefore play a significant role on the strength and variability of the observed total ozone decrease at mid-latitudes and should not be neglected in future climate change studies.\n",

      "Increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are likely to affect the trophic relationships that exist between plants, their herbivores, and the herbivores' natural enemies. We examined interactions across three trophic levels, a transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner cotton, an aphid herbivore (Aphis gossypii Glover), and a coccinellid predator (Leis axyridis Pallas) as affected by elevated CO2 concentrations. Experimental CO2 levels included ambient and 2X and 3X ambient CO2 levels. Plant height, biomass, leaf area, and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios were significantly higher in plants exposed to elevated CO2 levels compared with that in plants exposed to ambient CO2 More dry matter and fat content and less soluble protein were found in A. gossypii in elevated CO2 treatments. Cotton aphid fecundity significantly increased with increased CO2 concentrations. The aphid fecundity significantly increased through successive generations reared on plants grown under elevated CO2, suggesting that the changes in plant quality resulting from elevated CO2 altered aphid quality as prey for L. axyridis through the food chain. Significantly higher mean relative growth rates were observed in lady beetle larvae under elevated CO2 treatments. Also, the larval and pupal durations of the lady beetle were significantly shorter and aphid consumption rates increased when fed A. gossypii from elevated CO2 treatments. Our data showed that increasing CO2 concentrations could alter the preference of lady beetle to aphid prey and enhance the biological control of aphids by lady beetle. This study provides the first empirical evidence that changes in prey reared on host plants grown at different levels of CO2 can alter the feeding preference of their natural enemies.\n",

      "Effects of elevated CO2 levels on the amino acid constituents of cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii (Glover), fed on transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) (Bt) cotton [Cryl A(c)], grown in ambient and double-ambient CO2 levels in closed-dynamics CO2 chambers, were investigated. Lower amounts of amino acids were found in cotton phloem under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2 levels. However, higher amounts of free amino acids were found in A. gossypii fed on elevated CO2-grown cotton than those fed ambient CO2-grown cotton, and the contents of amino acids in honeydew were not significantly affected by elevated CO2 levels. A larger amount of honeydew was produced by cotton aphids feeding on leaves under elevated CO2 treatment than those feeding on leaves under ambient CO2 treatment, which indicates that A. gossypii ingests more cotton phloem because of the higher C:N ratio of cotton phloem under elevated CO2 levels. Moreover, the amino acid composition was similar in bodies of aphids ingesting leaves under both CO2 treatments, except for two alkaline amino acids, lysine and arginine. This suggests that the nutritional constitution of the phloem sap was important for A. gossypii. Our data suggest that more phloem sap will be ingested by A. gossypii to satisfy its nutritional requirement and balance the break-even point of amino acid in elevated CO2. Larger amounts of honeydew produced by A. gossypii under elevated CO2 will reduce the photosynthesis and result in the occurrence of some Entomophthora spp.\n",

      "The statistical linkage of daily precipitation to the National Centers for Environment Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data is described for De Bilt and Maastricht (Netherlands), and for Hamburg, Hanover and Berlin (Germany), using daily data for the period 1968-97. Two separate models were used to describe the daily precipitation at a particular site: an additive logistic model for rainfall occurrence and a generalized additive model for wet-day rainfall. Several dynamical variables and atmospheric moisture were included as predictor variables. The relative humidity at 700 hPa was considered as the moisture variable for rainfall occurrence modelling. For rainfall amount modelling, two options were compared: (i) the use of the specific humidity at 700 hPa, and (ii) the use of both the relative humidity at 700 hPa and precipitable water.An application is given with data from a time-dependent greenhouse gas forcing experiment using the coupled ECHAM4/OPYC3 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model for the periods 1968-97 and 2070-99. The fitted statistical relationships were used to estimate the changes in the mean number of wet days and the mean rainfall amounts for the winter and summer halves of the year at De Bilt, Hanover and Berlin. A decrease in the mean number of wet days was found. Despite this decrease, an increase in the mean seasonal rainfall amounts is predicted if specific humidity is used in the model for wet-day rainfall. This is caused by the larger atmospheric water content in the future climate. The effect of the increased atmospheric moisture is smaller if the alternative wet-day rainfall amount model with precipitable water and relative humidity is applied. Except for an anomalous change in mean winter rainfall at Hanover, the estimated changes from the latter model correspond quite well with those from the ECHAM4/OPYC3 model.Despite the flexibility of generalized additive models, the rainfall amount model systematically overpredicts the mean rainfall amounts in situations where extreme rainfall could be expected. Interaction between predictor effects has to be incorporated to reduce this bias. Copyright (C) 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.\n",

      "Tree stumps of Holocene age were identified and measured at three sites above the present tree-line on Mount Hauhungatahi, Tongariro National Park, New Zealand. Wood and pear were radiocarbon dated and annual rings in stump cross-sections counted for growth-rates. Comparative measurements were made in three plots in the modem subalpine forests. Stem densities and basal areas in the ancient forest were within the range of the modern subalpine forest samples. The conifers Halocarpus biformis, Phyllocladus asplenifolius var. alpinus, and Libocedrus bidwillii were present in both sets of samples, but in different proportions. Modem forest plots also contained Podocarpus hallii and angiosperm trees. Tree-line forest, composed predominantly of Halocarpus bidwillii, reached 1340 m by c. 10000 cal. BP and c. 1390 m by 8700 cal. BP. These early-Holocene H. bidwillii trees were slower-growing and longer-lived than the same species in current subalpine forests. From c. 5400 to 3800 cal. BP woody vegetation was again preserved. The current irregularly depressed timberline appears to have been initiated before the Taupo eruption (c. 1700 cal. BP). Charcoal indicates infrequent fires in the subalpine bogs and scrublands in post-Taupo time.\n",

      "A systematic increase in global temperature since the industrial revolution has been attributed to anthropogenic forcing. This increase has been especially evident over the Himalayas and Central Asia and is touted as a major contributing factor for glacier mass balance declines across much of this region. However, glaciers of Pakistan's Karakorum region have shown no such decline during this time period, and in some instances have exhibited slight advance. This discrepancy, known as the 'Karakorum Anomaly', has been attributed to unusual amounts of debris covering the region's glaciers; the unique seasonality of the region's precipitation; and localized cooling resulting from increased cloudiness from monsoonal moisture. Here we present a tree-ring based reconstruction of summer (June-August) temperature from the Karakorum of North Pakistan that spans nearly five centuries (1523-2007 C.E.). The ring width indices are derived from seven collections (six-Picea smithiana and one-Pinus gerardiana) from middle-to-upper timberline sites in the northern Karakorum valleys of Gilgit and Hunza at elevations ranging from 2850 to 3300 meters above mean sea level (mean elevation 3059 m asl). The reconstruction passes all traditional calibration-verification schemes and explains 41 % of the variance of the nested Gilgit-Astore instrumental station data (Gilgit-1454 m asl, 1951-2009; Astore-2167 m asl, 1960-2013). Importantly, our results indicate that Karakorum temperature has remained decidedly out of phase with hemispheric temperature trends for at the least the past five centuries, highlighting the long-term stability of the Karakorum Anomaly, and suggesting that the region's temperature and cloudiness are contributing factors to the anomaly.\n",

      "The growing season of high-elevation forests will presumably lengthen in response to warming. However, little is known about long-term effects of an extended growing season, particularly on the Tibetan Plateau. Based on a strong correlation between the daily mean temperatures at an automatic weather station at timberline (4,390 m a.s.l.) in the Sygera Mts., recorded since 2007, and at the meteorological station at Nyingchi (3,000 m a.s.l.), recorded since 1960, we modeled the variation in daily mean temperature at the timberline back to 1960. The onset and end of the growing season at the timberline were determined by the first and the last day within a year when the mean daily air temperature equals or exceeds, respectively falls below, +5 A degrees C for at least 5 days. From 1960 to 2010, the estimated length of the growing season at the timberline has significantly extended by 21.2 days, resulting mainly from a significant delay of its end (by 14.6 days) rather than from an earlier onset (by 6.6 days). Nevertheless, the variation of the length of the growing season did not exhibit any significant effect on the radial growth of Smith fir at the timberlines. Thus, tree-ring width is still a reliable proxy for summer temperature.\n",

      "[1] The complex response of the forest-tundra ecotone ( FT) to climate change may not generalize well geographically. We document FT changes in a nonpermafrost region of southcentral Alaska during a known warming period. Using 1951 and 1996 orthophotos overlain on digital elevation models across 800 km 2 of the west Kenai Mountains, we identified cover classes and topography for 978 random points and the highest closed-canopy conifer patches along 205 random altitudinal gradients. Results show 29% of FT area increased in woodiness, with closed-canopy forest expanding 14%/decade and shrubs 4%/decade; unvegetated areas decreased 17.4%/decade and tundra 5%/decade. Area of open woodland remained constant but changed location. Timberline, estimated using both the 205 altitudinal gradients and the upper quartile elevations of closed-canopy forest among the 978 points, rose very little. Tree line, identified using upper quartiles of open woodland, rose similar to 50 m on cool, northerly aspects, but not on other aspects. Dendrochronology on high-elevation seedlings showed a congruence between decadal recruitment and regional changes in climate from 1945 to 2005. Patterns observed in the climatic FT of the Kenai Mountains corroborate other studies that show regional and landscape specificity of the structural response of FT to climate change. FT shifted upwards on cooler, presumably more mesic aspects near seed sources; however, on warm aspects the density of shrubs and trees increased, but FT did not rise. If current conditions continue for the next 50-100 years, the Kenai FT will markedly change to a far woodier landscape with less tundra and more closed-canopy forest.\n",

      "Shrubs and dwarf shrubs are wider spread on the Tibetan Plateau than trees and hence offer a unique opportunity to expand the present dendrochronological network into extreme environments beyond the survival limit of trees. Alpine shrublands on the Tibetan Plateau are characterized by rhododendron species. The dendrochronological potential of one alpine rhododendron species and its growth response to the extreme environment on the south-east Tibetan Plateau were investigated.Twenty stem discs of the alpine snowy rhododendron (Rhododendron nivale) were collected close to the tongue of the Zuoqiupu Glacier in south-east Tibet, China. The skeleton plot technique was used for inter-comparison between samples to detect the growth pattern of each stem section. The ring-width chronology was developed by fitting a negative exponential function or a straight line of any slope. Bootstrapping correlations were calculated between the standard chronology and monthly climate data.The wood of snowy rhododendron is diffuse-porous with evenly distributed small-diameter vessels. It has well-defined growth rings. Most stem sections can be visually and statistically cross-dated. The resulting 75-year-long standard ring-width chronology is highly correlated with a timberline fir chronology about 200 km apart, providing a high degree of confidence in the cross-dating. The climate/growth association of alpine snowy rhododendron and of this timberline fir is similar, reflecting an impact of monthly mean minimum temperatures in November of the previous year and in July during the year of ring formation.The alpine snowy rhododendron offers new research directions to investigate the environmental history of the Tibetan Plateau in those regions where up to now there was no chance of applying dendrochronology.\n",

      "This paper presents the outcome of a workshop, held in Berlin in February 2009, concerned with current research on the glacial history of northern Europe, including the British Isles. The methodologies presently used to resolve this topic are outlined. Particular attention is given to new analytical methods deriving from high resolution remote imaging of glacial terrain both on land and on the sea-bed, key new stratigraphic sections, higher resolution results from conventional geochronological methods like radiocarbon and more recently developed technologies such as luminescence and cosmogenic radionuclide dating. The relationships between the results derived from these two methods are discussed in further detail along with possible explanations for these differences. An outline of a 'most likely' glacial history of the Scandinavian and British and Irish Ice Sheets is presented along with possible links to global climate change as represented by the marine isotope (MIS) record. Tentative evidence for glaciation is identified in MIS 22, 16, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4 and 2 and correlations of 'phases' within the Last Glaciation are also explored for both the Scandinavian and British and Irish Ice Sheets. The results show that the character and extent of glaciation in different parts of the region are not synchronous and much more geochronological work is required before regional correlations can be established with confidence.

      "This study provides a new look at the observed and calculated long-term temperature changes from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere since 1958 over the Northern Hemisphere. The data sets include the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, the Free University of Berlin (FU-Berlin) and the RICH radiosonde data sets as well as historical simulations with the CESM1-WACCM global model participating in CMIP5. The analysis is mainly based on monthly layer mean temperatures derived from geopotential height thicknesses in order to take advantage of the use of the independent FU-Berlin stratospheric data set of geopotential height data since 1957. This approach was followed to extend the records for the investigation of the stratospheric temperature trends to the earliest possible time. After removing the natural variability with an autoregressive multiple regression model our analysis shows that the period 1958-2011 can be divided into two distinct sub-periods of long-term temperature variability and trends: before and after 1980. By calculating trends for the summer time to reduce interannual variability, the two periods are as follows. From 1958 until 1979, a non-significant trend (0.06 +/- 0.06 degrees C decade(-1) for NCEP) and slightly cooling trends (-0.12 +/- 0.06 degrees C decade(-1) for RICH) are found in the lower troposphere. The second period from 1980 to the end of the records shows significant warming (0.25 +/- 0.05 degrees C decade(-1) for both NCEP and RICH). Above the tropopause a significant cooling trend is clearly seen in the lower stratosphere both in the pre-1980 period (-0.58 +/- 0.17 degrees C decade(-1) for NCEP, -0.30 +/- 0.16 degrees C decade(-1) for RICH and -0.48 +/- 0.20 degrees C decade(-1) for FU-Berlin) and the post-1980 period (-0.79 +/- 0.18 degrees C decade(-1) for NCEP, -0.66 +/- 0.16 degrees C decade(-1) for RICH and -0.82 +/- 0.19 degrees C decade(-1) for FU-Berlin). The cooling in the lower stratosphere persists throughout the year from the tropics up to 60 degrees N. At polar latitudes competing dynamical and radiative processes reduce the statistical significance of these trends. Model results are in line with reanalysis and the observations, indicating a persistent cooling (-0.33 degrees C decade(-1)) in the lower stratosphere during summer before and after 1980; a feature that is also seen throughout the year. However, the lower stratosphere CESM1-WACCM modelled trends are generally lower than reanalysis and the observations. The contrasting effects of ozone depletion at polar latitudes in winter/spring and the anticipated strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson circulation from man-made global warming at polar latitudes are discussed. Our results provide additional evidence for an early greenhouse cooling signal in the lower stratosphere before 1980, which appears well in advance relative to the tropospheric greenhouse warming signal. The suitability of early warning signals in the stratosphere relative to the troposphere is supported by the fact that the stratosphere is less sensitive to changes due to cloudiness, humidity and man-made aerosols. Our analysis also indicates that the relative contribution of the lower stratosphere versus the upper troposphere low-frequency variability is important for understanding the added value of the long-term tropopause variability related to human-induced global warming.\n",

      "Ancient cave systems in the Northern Calcareous Alps, today located well above the timberline at altitudes of 2400-2500 m, host U-rich speleothems that preserved growth layers on the microscopic scale of presumably annual origin. Two flowstone samples were dated to 2.019 + 0.037/-0.069 Ma and 1.730 + 0.032/-0.068 Ma, respectively, using U-Pb isochron techniques. These ages are corroborated by the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene pollen spectrum extracted from one of the samples. We use a multiproxy approach and exploit laminated speleothem sequences to tie high-resolution stable isotope data to a floating lamina-counted chronology. O isotope values of growth intervals when calcite deposition was close to isotopic equilibrium are low compared to modern and Holocene speleothems from other alpine caves and are inconsistent with the current altitudinal setting of the caves. A vegetated but geomorphologically stable alpine catchment (i.e. similar to 2000 m asl., no (peri)glacial processes) combined with a deep-seated cave (the thickness of the vadose zone might have exceeded 1000 m) is required in order to reconcile the isotopic data with the pollen record and the petrographic evidence. Furthermore, the data can be used to constrain the rate for Quaternary rock-uplift to <= 0.8 mm/annum for this frontal part of the European Alps. Collectively, the data suggest that these speleothems formed both during interglacials (MIS 59 or 61) and interglacial-glacial transitions (MIS 75/74 or 77/76), but the seasonal precipitation pattern was arguably markedly different from today's. Provided that the highly regular microscopic laminae are indeed annual, lamina counts suggest a minimum length of ca 6 ka for interglacials during the earliest Pleistocene. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Tree-ring width (TRW) and stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) in tree-ring cellulose of subalpine fir (Abies fabri) were used to develop high-resolution climate proxy data to indicate snow-depth variations in the Gongga Mountain, west China. Tree radial growth- and delta C-13-climate response analyses demonstrated that the TRW and delta C-13 at the timberline (3,400 m.a.s.l.) are mainly influenced by temperature and precipitation of previous growth seasons and current summer (June to August) under cold and humid conditions. Considering the analogous control factors on both tree growth and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) and snow accumulation, the negative and significant relationships between tree-ring parameters (TRW and Delta C-13) and mean monthly snowpack depth were found. Herein, by combining two tree-ring parameters, a primary snow-depth reconstruction (previous October to current May) over the reliable period A.D. 1880-2004 was estimated. The reconstruction explains 58.0% of the variance in the instrumental record, and in particular captures the longer-term fluctuations successfully. Except the period with extreme higher snowpack depth around 1990, the snowpack depth seems to fluctuate in a normal way. The reconstruction agrees with the nearby snowpack depth record in Kangding and the mean observed snowpack-depth variations of the stations on the Tibetan Plateau, particularly at long-term scales. The snowpack depth in low-frequency fluctuations, during the past century, agrees quite well with the Eastern India precipitation covering the period of previous October-current May. Our results suggest that combing tree-ring width and delta C-13 in certain subalpine tree species growing on the Tibetan Plateau may be an effective way for reconstructing regional snowpack variations.\n",

      "Projected changes in global climate have substantial ramifications for biological diversity and the management of natural areas.  We explored the potential implications of global climate change for biogeographic patterns in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem by using a conceptual model to compare three likely climate scenarios:  (1) warmer and drier than the present; (2) warmer and drier, but with a compensating increase in plant water use efficiency; and (3) warmer and wetter than the present.  The logical consequences of each scenario are projected for several species and community types chosen to represent a range of local climate conditions and biotic responses in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.  The upper and lower timberline appear to be particularly sensitive to climate change.  The upper timberline is likely to migrate upward in elevation in response to temperature changes, whereas the lower treeline may retreat under drier conditions or move down slope under wetter conditions.  In all scenarios, the extent of alpine vegetation in the ecosystem decreased.  Climate-induced changes in the fire regime in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem would probably have substantial consequences for the extent and age-class distribution of forest communities.  Alterations in the distribution and extent of grassland communities would affect the populations of large ungulates.  Our analyses suggest directions for establishing long-term measurements for the early detection of responses to climate change.\n",

      "This review considers potential effects of atmospheric change and climate warming within the timberline ecotone of the Central European Alps. After focusing on the impacts of ozone (O-3) and rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, effects of climate warming on the carbon and water balance of timberline trees and forests will be outlined towards conclusions about changes in tree growth and treeline dynamics.Presently, ambient ground-level O-3 concentrations do not exert crucial stress on adult conifers at the timberline of the Central European Alps. In response to elevated atmospheric CO2 Larix decidua showed growth increase, whereas no such response was found in Pinus uncinata. Overall climate warming appears as the factor responsible for the observed growth stimulation of timberline trees.Increased seedling re-establishment in the Central European Alps however, resulted from invasion into potential habitats rather than upward migration due to climate change, although seedlings will only reach tree size upon successful coupling with the atmosphere and thus loosing the beneficial microclimate of low stature vegetation.In conclusion, future climate extremes are more likely than the gradual temperature increase to control treeline dynamics in the Central European Alps.\n",

      "The periodicity of climatic processes along the Russian Arctic Ocean coast has been studied by analyzing the tree-ring chronologies for the regions close to the northern timberline. The wavelet analysis of annual series of conifer tree rings for the period 1458-1975 has revealed climatic oscillations with periods of 20-25 years. The amplitudes and periods of climatic oscillations in the region of Russian Arctic Ocean proved to exhibit appreciable changes. Especially strong climatic variations in comparison with the recent ones were found to occur during the Maunder minimum epoch when the period of oscillations increased from 22-23 years to 24-29 years, and oscillations with periods of 15 years appeared. After the Maunder minimum, the periods of oscillations and their amplitudes again decreased, and the 15-16-year maximum disappeared. Analysis of solar activity based on of radiocarbon (C-14) concentration in annual tree rings has revealed a similar pattern in changes of periodicity before, during, and after the Maunder minimum. This suggests that quasi-bidecadal climatic oscillations and variations in solar activity can be connected with each other. A possible solar forcing of periodic climatic processes and its nonlinear influence on the atmosphere-ocean-continental system are discussed. The intense quasi-bidecadal climatic oscillations can be, in all probability, interpreted as resulting from amplification of a weak solar signal in the atmosphere-ocean system that has its own noises whose frequencies are close to the 22-23-year solar cycles.\n",

      "This was the topic of an Expert Meeting arranged by the VDI-Gesellschaft fur Energietechnik at the Berlin Palace Hotel on September 28-29, 1999 and attended by roughly one hundred experts, almost exclusively from Germany. The meeting was organized to examine the economic impact of Germany's sole opting out of a high technology in the face of a growing worldwide energy requirement, and whether this approach will allow the objectives of carbon dioxide reduction to be achieved in the interest of climate protection. The detailed points discussed at the meeting included the economic consequences for Germany arising from the country's opting out of the use of nuclear power; the preservation of competence in nuclear technology; the future role of nuclear power in the EU; the energy options existing for climate protection. In addition, political discussions were held with representatives of the political parties.

      "The objective of the paper was to quantify the water use efficiency (WUE) of different crops on lowland soils. This is relevant to agriculture for effective growing of bioenergy plants and sequestering carbon in plant biomass and soils.On two groundwater lysimeter stations in the vicinity of Berlin, Germany, a long-term study has been conducted. Above ground biomass, evapotranspiration (ET), proportion of subirrigated water and water use efficiency have been measured on soils of different texture.To quantify the effect of different water tables on crop biomass, additionally plant biomass production has been measured on surrounding farm plots. The climate was characterized by a mean temperature of 9.4 degrees C and an annual precipitation of 500-600 mm during the period of study.Subirrigation water requirements strongly depended on water table depths, crops and soil texture and showed a large variability between different years due to weather conditions. Spring barley consumed 10-60 mm of groundwater, winter wheat 20-250 mm, pasture and meadow grasses 80-300 mm, maize 100-400 mm, reed canary grass 400-900 mm, sedges 600-1000 mm and common reed 700-1200 mm. The ET in terms of the crop coefficient coincided with common recommendations, except from wetland plants, where it was higher than those. ET and above ground biomass were clearly crop-specific correlated. Plant type associated with appropriate water table depth, fertilization level and soil fertility were crucial factors of WUE. Results showed possible high dry matter biomass at all water table levels, but increasing WUE with deeper water tables when growing arable crops. Maize had the highest WUE with 4-6 g dry matter per I of water, followed by winter wheat, with a WUE of about 3. Wetland plants also produced high amounts of biomass but consumed more water. Their WUE was less than 1.5.Field plots had lower drainage and subirrigation intensity than lysimeters and thus indicated both waterlogging and drought stress. This resulted in significant and strong correlations between groundwater table and biomass of arable crops. As in lysimeters, the highest WUE occurred with the highest crop biomass, it may be concluded that in field situations, highest WUE can be achieved with controlling an optimum range of water table. Crops of highest WUE, maize and winter wheat, had optimum water tables in the range of 80-160 cm on soils of higher water storage capacity. Grassland required water tables less than 80 cm. Creating rewetted areas of water tables less than 20 cm would mean a very low efficiency of water use. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "MAMAP is an airborne passive remote sensing instrument designed to measure the dry columns of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The MAMAP instrument comprises two optical grating spectrometers: the first observing in the short wave infrared band (SWIR) at 1590-1690 nm to measure CO2 and CH4 absorptions, and the second in the near infrared (NIR) at 757-768 nm to measure O-2 absorptions for reference/normalisation purposes. MAMAP can be operated in both nadir and zenith geometry during the flight. Mounted on an aeroplane, MAMAP surveys areas on regional to local scales with a ground pixel resolution of approximately 29 m x 33 m for a typical aircraft altitude of 1250 m and a velocity of 200 km h(-1). The retrieval precision of the measured column relative to background is typically <= 1% (1 sigma). MAMAP measurements are valuable to close the gap between satellite data, having global coverage but with a rather coarse resolution, on the one hand, and highly accurate in situ measurements with sparse coverage on the other hand. In July 2007, test flights were performed over two coal-fired power plants operated by Vattenfall Europe Generation AG: Janschwalde (27.4 Mt CO2 yr(-1)) and Schwarze Pumpe (11.9 Mt CO2 yr-1), about 100 km southeast of Berlin, Germany. By using two different inversion approaches, one based on an optimal estimation scheme to fit Gaussian plume models from multiple sources to the data, and another using a simple Gaussian integral method, the emission rates can be determined and compared with emissions reported by Vattenfall Europe. An extensive error analysis for the retrieval's dry column results (XCO2 and XCH4) and for the two inversion methods has been performed. Both methods - the Gaussian plume model fit and the Gaussian integral method - are capable of deriving estimates for strong point source emission rates that are within +/- 10% of the reported values, given appropriate flight patterns and detailed knowledge of wind conditions.\n",

      "Tree-ring series from living trees near the timberline or timbers buried in the surroundings are exceptionally valuable both for climate reconstruction and investigations of the consequences of climate change to ecosystems.This paper is a critical assessment of the past and potential contributions of dendroecology and dendroclimatology in mountain environments. Problems addressed are the spatial variability of both climate and tree sites, the temporal variability of ecological growth conditions and the reconstruction of signals other than high frequency ones. A synaptic approach appears to be the only way to take into account both the spatial and temporal variability of tree-growth, allowing for a better comparison of spatial climatological patterns with spatial growth patterns.\n",

      "I replicated and analyzed six photographs taken in A.D. 1870 near the subalpine forest-alpine tundra ecotone in the northern Uinta Mountains to quantify changes in the distribution of vegetation. Three dramatic differences were noted. First, the historical photographs document a treeline 60 to 180 m (mean of similar to 100 m) lower than at present, with greater depression on west-facing slopes. Given the modem lapse rate for mean July temperature (6.9degreesC km(-1)), this difference corresponds to a temperature depression in A.D. 1870 of 0.4 to 1.2degreesC (mean of 0.7degreesC). Second, timberline forests in A.D. 1870 were significantly (P < 0.01) less dense, with tree densities approximately half those measured in the modern photographs. Third, the area of floodplain meadows decreased &SIM;75% from A.D. 1870 to the present. Because the original photographs were taken within a few decades of the end of the Little Ice Age, ca. A.D. 1850, 1 assumed that differences in vegetation distribution documented in the repeat photographs represent the biotic response to climate warming over the past &SIM; 130 yr. This analysis provides an independent estimate of the magnitude of growing season temperature depression during the Little Ice Age.\n",

      "Tree-ring studies may help better understand climate variability and extreme climate event frequency and are especially useful in regions where detailed meteorological records lack. We studied the effect of droughts and unusually cold periods on Pinus sylvestris tree-ring width and wood anatomy. Study sites were selected along an altitudinal gradient on Vitosha Mountain, Bulgaria. Drought conditions caused the formation of narrow tree rings or light rings if the drought occurred in July-August at the lower altitude sites. In years with droughts in June and the first half of July, followed by precipitation in the middle of July, intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) were formed. Trees in the zone with optimal growth conditions produced fewer light rings and narrow rings in years with either strongest droughts or unusually cold summers. At the timberline zone, low summer temperature triggered narrow tree rings and light rings. Frost rings were formed when there was a drop in temperatures below the freezing point in the second half of May or at the beginning of June. Our findings show that studies of tree-ring anatomy may contribute to obtain further knowledge about extreme climatic events in the Balkan Peninsula and in other regions where meteorological data lack.\n",

      "We investigated the variability in spatial pattern of some structural, dendrochronological and dendroclimatological features of a mixed Larix decidua-Pinus cembra forest at (he timberline in the eastern Italian Alps at fine geographical and temporal scales. Forest structure variables such as stern diameter, tree height. age and tree-ring related parameters (yearly growth index, mean sensitivity, first order autocorrelation and some dendroclimatic variables) have been compared at various scale levels. We observed that most of the variables show positive autocorrelated structures due to both forest dynamics and fine-scale driving forces, probably related to microrelief. Spatial structure of yearly indexed radial growth appears sensitive to extreme climatic events. Secondary succession after past disturbances drives the forest towards a structure governed by a gap regeneration dynamics that seems to ensure the different requirements of the two main tree species present. Small spatial scale studies of forest structures, especially if integrated to dendro-ecological data, seem an efficient toot to assess the disturbance regime and species sensitivity to environmental change.\n",

      "In this study, the seasonally averaged intradiurnal patterns of four different pollen types (Fraxinus, Betula, Poaceae and Artemisia) and the role of traffic volume, air pollution and selected weather parameters were investigated. Measurements were carried out with a 7-day recording volumetric spore trap (Hirst type) near a congested city motorway (the A 100) in Berlin, Germany, in 2012, 2013 and partly 2011. Both Poaceae and Artemisia pollen showed distinct patterns which were similar across the years. The main period of grass pollen concentrations in the air was from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. with peaks about midday or in the afternoon. Mugwort pollen mainly occurred between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. with a clear maximum from 8 to 10 a.m. With regard to Fraxinus and Betula pollen, the patterns were not as clear and showed differences throughout the years. The intradiurnal patterns of traffic volume and pollen load, mainly of Poaceae in the afternoon and Artemisia in the morning, were partly coincident. The combination of both a high pollen count and air pollution, due to exhaust emissions, represents a special health threat which could result in a double burden for allergy sufferers. In the case of the daily means of Betula and Poaceae, relative humidity had a significantly negative effect on pollen concentrations on the same and/or next day/s, sunshine duration (Poaceae) and air temperature (Artemisia) a positive one.\n",

      "Analyses of Eemian climate dynamics based on different reconstruction methods were conducted for several pollen sequences in the northern alpine foreland. The modem analogue and mutual climate sphere techniques used, which are briefly presented, complement one another with respect to comparable results. The reconstructions reveal the occurrence of at least two similar thermal periods, representing temperate oceanic conditions warmer and with a higher humidity than today., Intense changes of climate processes become obvious with a shift of winter temperatures of about 15degreesC from the late Rissian to the first thermal optimum of the Eemian. The transition shows a pattern of summer temperatures and precipitation increasing, more rapidly than winter temperatures. With the first optimum during the Pinus-Quercetum mixtum-Corylus phase (PQC) at an early stage of the Eemian and a second optimum period at a later stage, which is characterised by widespread Carpinus, climate gradients across the study area were less intense than today. Average winter temperatures vary between -1.9 and 0.4degreesC (present-day -3.6 to 1.4degreesC), summer temperatures between 17.8 and. 19.6degreesC, (present-day 14 to 18.9degreesC). The timberline expanded about 350 m when compared to the present-day limit represented by Pinus mugo. Whereas the maximum of temperature parameters is related to the first optimum, precipitation above 1100 mm is higher during the second warm period concomitant to somewhat reduced temperatures. Intermediate, smaller climate oscillations and a cooling becomes obvious, which admittedly represent moderate deterioration but not extreme chills. During the boreal semicontinental Eemian Pinus-Picea-Abies phase, another less distinct fluctuation occurs, initiating the oscillating shift from temperate to cold conditions.

      "Radial growth was examined in two Scots pine stands that were seeded during the 1920s and 1930s due to reforestation and afforestation activity on the timberline of northern Finnish Lapland. Tree-rings of seeded pines were calibrated against the instrumental records of local weather and large-scale atmospheric patterns and further compared to pines of natural origin on the timberline. The studied stands were shown to contain common growth variability that differed from the variability of natural pines. Deviating growth of seeded pines was attributed to their only moderate growth dependence on mid-summer (July) temperatures and, likewise, their strong dependence on the autumn climate in the previous year, and linked to the different genetic origin of artificial stands due to southern seeds. Stands were thinned for different densities in 1985 and 1986. The growth response to thinning was markedly better than could be expected according to previous studies. We found that the positive growth reaction conceivably benefited from the ameliorated winter conditions, expressed as warmed (March) temperatures and the prolonged positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (February). The results emphasize the determining influence of climatic fluctuations on reforestation and afforestation near the distributional limits of tree species.\n",

      "Temperature is suggested to determine the upper limit of tree life. Therefore, future climate warming may be of importance for tree distribution within the European Alps, where low temperatures limit carbon metabolism.We focused on the effects of air and soil temperature on net photosynthesis (P(n)) of Pinus cembra an evergreen climax species of the timberline ecotone of the Central Austrian Alps. Light response and temperature response curves were estimated along an altitudinal gradient ranging from the forest limit up to the krummholz limit in both summer and fall.In general, P(n) was significantly lower in fall as compared to summer. Nevertheless, independent from season mean P(n) values tended to increase with elevation and were positively correlated with root zone temperatures. The specific leaf area by contrast declined with increasing elevation. Furthermore, the temperature optimum of net photosynthesis declined with increasing elevation and was positively correlated with the mean maximum air temperature of the 10 days prior the date of measurement.Thus, our findings appear to reflect a long-term adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus of Pinus cembra to the general temperature conditions with respect to elevation combined with a short term acclimation to the prevailing temperature regime.\n",

      "Simultaneous measurements of soil temperature and moisture and related climate and vegetation variables at high altitudes are rare. Such knowledge is important to predict soil temperature and moisture across heterogeneous alpine landscapes and the impact of climate warming on alpine ecosystems. Based on the four-year observations in 12 plots across two contrasting timberline ecotones (north-facing Abies georgei var. smithii and south-facing Juniperus saltuaria timberlines of a valley) in the Sergyemla Mountains, we aimed to determine the role of altitude, aspect, climate, soil, and vegetation variables affecting the variability of soil temperature and moisture. The two timberlines had similar annual precipitation and seasonal mean air temperature, but the growing-season mean soil temperature differed by 0.8-1.0 K. The spring soil warming date was 20-30 days later on the north-facing slope than on the south-facing slope, which was associated with increased snow and vegetation covers on the north-facing slope. Slope aspect, canopy height, and leaf area index (LAI) rather than altitude were the major determining factors for spatial variability of seasonal mean soil temperatures across plots. A combination of aspect southness and canopy height/LAI explained 56-77% of the variations in the -20 cm mean soil temperatures for the year, growing season, and July across the 12 plots. In contrast, seasonal mean soil moistures did not correlate with altitude, aspect, and stand and soil variables. Furthermore, the -5 cm soil temperature amplitude in the growing season was much lower in the north-facing fir forest than in the south-facing juniper forest, suggesting an explanation for the distribution pattern of both species timberlines on opposite slopes of a valley in the Sergyemla Mountains.\n",

      "Different technologies for tertiary wastewater treatment are compared in their environmental impacts with life cycle assessment (LCA). Targeting very low phosphorus concentration (50-120 mu g/L) and seasonal disinfection of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) secondary effluent, this LCA compares high-rate sedimentation, microsieve, dual media filtration (all with UV disinfection), and polymer ultrafiltration or ceramic microfiltration membranes for upgrading the large WWTP Berlin-Ruhleben. Results of the LCA show that mean effluent quality of membranes is highest, but at the cost of high electricity and chemical demand and associated emissions of greenhouse gases or other air pollutants. In contrast, gravity-driven treatment processes require less electricity and chemicals, but can reach significant removal of phosphorus. In fact, dual media filter or microsieve cause substantially lower specific CO2 emissions per kg P removed from the secondary effluent (180 kg CO2-eq/kg P, including UV) than the membrane schemes (275 kg CO2-eq/kg P).\n",

      "Pollution levels in urban areas and their surrounding rural regions differ due to different sources and density of emissions, different composition of pollutants as well as specific meteorological effects. These concentration differences for PM10 are investigated and compared in this study for three different northwest European urban agglomerations: The German Ruhr area, the Dutch Randstad and the German city of Berlin. Measurement data for PM10 for the years 2003-2008 at urban and rural background stations are selected from the AirBase database to specify the PM10 concentration difference between these urban areas and their surrounding rural regions, here defined as the urban increment. Whereas the absolute and relative measured urban increment averaged over the years 2003-2008 for the Ruhr area (7.4 mu g m(-3), 35%) and Berlin (8.5 mu g m(-3), 46%) are comparable in magnitude, a significantly smaller value is found for the Randstad (3.1 mu g m(-3), 12%). To analyze whether the regional chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS is able to reproduce the measured urban increment simulation runs were performed for 2003-2008 on a 0.5 degrees x 0.25 degrees lon-lat grid covering Europe and for the year 2008 on a finer grid of 0.125 degrees x 0.0625 degrees covering the Netherlands and Germany, both with ECMWF meteorology as input. Although the model underestimates the absolute PM10 urban increment averaged over the years 2003-2008 for the Ruhr area (3.3 mu g m(-3), 33%), the Randstad (1.5 mu g m(-3), 12%) and Berlin (1.7 mu g m(-3), 27%), the relative urban increment for the Ruhr area and the Randstad is in general agreement with the measurements. The tested increase of the horizontal resolution gives no systematic improvement of the simulated urban increment. However, an even higher resolution than used here seems to be more appropriate to capture the urban increment (especially for Berlin).The variability of the PM10 urban increment with weather is tested by means of the summer 2003, such an extreme synoptic situation is expected to occur more often in future. Measured and simulated PM10 concentrations in summer 2003 were compared to the summer average of 2003-2008. The response of the observed urban increment was found to depend on the urban area. In general the model reproduces the main features for the Randstad and Berlin.In order to investigate the impact of a changing climate on the PM10 urban increment, simulations were performed with the off-line coupled model system RACMO2 (regional climate model) - LOTOS-EUROS (air quality model) over Europe. Different sets of simulations were carried out using RACMO2 meteorology with ECHAM5 A1B and with MIROC3.2-hires A1B boundary conditions for the time period 1970-2060, as well as with ERA-interim boundary conditions for the time period 1989-2009. Anthropogenic emissions were kept constant in the LOTOS-EUROS simulations. Simulated concentrations differ between the runs using ECHAM and MIROC boundary conditions and both runs differ from the present-day simulations with ERA-interim forcing. The impact of climate change on the modeled PM10 concentrations and the urban increment was found to be small in both scenario runs. However the concentration differences between the simulations forced by either ECHAM or MIROC indicate that PM10 concentration levels are sensitive to circulation patterns rather than temperature change alone, and that PM10 concentration levels may thus change when circulation patterns change in the future.

      "Global warming increases the vertical stability in small lakes and makes a future transition between different mixing regimes possible. In order to estimate this effect, the one-dimensional lake temperature model, FLake, is applied to two lakes located in Berlin, Germany, that have similar morphometrical characteristics but that differ in the mixing regime. The model is driven by long-term meteorological data and by regional climate scenarios. The current rate of increase in the year-round lake temperature of 0.3 degrees C per decade is found to coincide with the trend in the air temperature. The warming rates are unevenly redistributed over the seasons and across the water column; the strongest warming occurs in winter and slight cooling of the near-bottom waters occurs in summer. In future scenarios, both lakes change their mixing regime to warm monomictic over the course of the century. Successive transitions between poly-, di- and monomictic states reveal themselves through a series of abrupt changes in the near-bottom temperature during summer, which can significantly affect the water sediment nutrient exchange and the benthic biological communities.\n",

      "Sediment cores from Pyramid Lake, an alpine tarn in the Cassiar Mountains of northwestern British Columbia, were investigated for changes in pollen, plant macrofossils, charcoal, and elastic sediment, which are used to infer changes in climate throughout the Holocene. Radiometric dating has yielded a chronology of high-magnitude rainstorm events and timberline migration for the Pyramid Lake basin since deglaciation at about 10600 B.P. Fifteen distinct minerogenic layers represent material delivered to the lake by runoff events. The frequency of minerogenic layer deposition, and by analogy of storms, has changed throughout the Holocene. Four large-magnitude rainstorm events occurred between 4400 and 5100 B.P. During this period white spruce (Picea cf. glauca) was likely present near the lake, although a closed forest stand did not develop around the lake at any point during the Holocene. The macrofossil record indicates that subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) has been present, likely as krummholz, above the elevation of the lake since at least 9400 B.P. Pollen of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) is represented from ca. 1500 B.P. to the present and may be a consequence of changes in regional airmass circulation patterns.\n",

      "In some French mountain areas, the land-use changes which started around 1850 have resulted in a complete abandonment of any agro-pastoral activity by 1950. Thus, the landscape underwent important modifications of structure and functioning. Tree invasion did not take place homogeneously in space or time. Using aerial photographs I mapped the recolonization areas at timberline and analyzed the spatial pattern and age structure of sample plots established in stands in the recolonization zones above 2000 m a.s.l. I identified four main establishment periods, with the most important forest edge dynamics happening during the most recent periods: (1) immediately after abandonment of the pastures 50 years ago, European larch (Larix decidua Miller) formed very dense colonization patches close to the ancient chalets. The invasion was limited to narrow fringes related to colluvial soil conditions alongside the forest edges. Now Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) is regenerating in these young larch woods. (2) During the last two decades, stone pine has regenerated massively at tree line, forming dense seedling patches, mostly on convex relief forms. The spatial restriction of the young forests, be it stone pine or larch stands, enhances the importance of relief and soil conditions for vegetation dynamics at timberline. The landscape structure and the land-use history are determinant for the assessment of forest edge dynamics and consequently for the study and prediction of timberline fluctuations.

      "Both land use and expected climate change will probably cause range shifts of tree and shrub species in the European Alps. Attempts to predict the magnitude and direction of these processes will produce reliable results only if they consider both abiotic habitat conditions and biotic interactions. In this study we analyze recruitment patterns of Pinus mugo Turra in different grassland communities of the Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria. Pinus mugo is the most important invader of abandoned subalpine pastures in the area and the predominant woody plant at the current timberline. Results indicate strong dependence of colonization success on propagule pressure and differential invasibility of grassland types but only a marginal impact of local-scale site conditions, at least within the species' current altitudinal distribution limits. Because the grassland matrix at and above the current treeline is dominated by a particularly invasible grassland type, a possible climate change-driven upward movement of Pinus mugo shrublands may take place quite rapidly. In contrast, encroachment on abandoned subalpine pastures is frequently delayed by competition with vigorous grassland canopies.\n",

      "Xylogenesis was monitored during 2003 and 2004 in a timberline environment in southern Italy to assess links between temperature, cambial phenology and wood formation on a short-time scale. Wood microcores were collected weekly from May to October from 10 trees of Pinus leucodermis Ant., histological sections were cut with a rotary microtome and anatomical features of the developing and mature tracheids were observed and measured along the growing tree ring. Spring 2003 was hotter than spring 2004, with temperatures up to 2.6 degrees C above historical means. The hotter conditions resulted in an earlier onset of cambial activity and all differentiation phases of about 20 days, resulting in an increased duration of xylogenesis of about 23 days. Air and stem temperatures at which xylogenesis had a 0.5 probability of being active were calculated with logistic regressions fitted on binary responses. In both years, similar thresholds were estimated with daily mean values of 8.2 and 9.5 degrees C for air and stem temperatures, respectively. The observed convergent responses of cambium phenology to temperature during the two contrasting springs confirm the key role of this environmental factor in determining the onset and duration of wood formation in timberline areas. The intra-annual dynamics of ring-width increase differed between years, with significantly narrower rings formed in 2004 than in 2003. These differences were mainly related to cell size because larger earlywood tracheids were produced in 2003. This study demonstrates the plasticity of tree-ring formation in response to high temperatures as a result of modifications in the onset and duration of differentiation.\n",

      "In the current debates on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the mobility sector, hydrogen produced via water electrolysis from renewable electricity is commonly regarded to be a sustainable energy carrier with large potential for decarbonisation of the mobility sector. Directly produced at the refueling stations site, hydrogen greenhouse gas emissions are presently defined to be zero in e.g. the Directives of the European Union since emissions arising from the facilities construction are defined to be negligible. In order to check the validity of this assumption with respect to the latest technical developments in hydrogen supply, the present article aims to report the environmental performance of hydrogen being produced and compressed for mobility purposes. To this end, a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling station (HRS) with an on-site alkaline electrolyser is assessed, which was built and operated in Berlin. Assuming electricity supply from wind energy generation, a life cycle assessment for the complete value chain was carried out where primary data for the build-up of electrolyser and HRS were obtained during decommissioning of the station.The results show that the construction of HRS and on-site electrolyser requires higher material and energy expenditures compared to previous investigations on similar but technically less advanced systems. These expenditures generate a significant footprint in the specific e.g. greenhouse gas emissions if the electrolyser is operated at a reduced load factor as it may be foreseen for grid stabilisation purposes. To ensure a strong reduction of emissions compared to conventional fuels, this load factor should be sufficiently high and should be defined to not fall under a certain threshold in upcoming directives. Besides, excessive use of supplies should be avoided and the refueling station should be operated with renewable electricity to the largest extent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "As one of the most conspicuous boundaries between different types of ecosystem, the alpine timberline has attracted the interest of researchers in Innsbruck for more than 85 years. It is evident that the tree life form here reaches its absolute limit and is constrained by the harsh environment. However, the nature of constraints is less obvious and requires detailed ecophysiological analyses as exemplified in this review, which concentrates on the Central Tyrolean Alps. After focusing on the timberline environment, effects of elevation on the water relations and the CO2 gas exchange of timberline-associated conifer species will be outlined towards conclusions on tree growth and treeline fluctuations. Presently, temperature is suggested to be the key environmental factor in determining the transition from forests to alpine shrub and grassland. As many physiological aspects are influenced directly or indirectly by the temperature regime at the alpine timberline, tree life at the timberline exists close to a number of physiological limits which interact to determine the position of the alpine timberline and modulate the upper boundary of tree life. Nevertheless, understanding of the altitude of the treeline must also consider seedling establishment, especially when evaluating treeline advances and global change effects in a changing environment.\n",

      "Recently the set up of a stable carbon isotope chronology of juniper tree rings of the eastern Tibet timberline has been initiated. First results for the last 800 years will be presented.The dominant delta(13)C pattern shows higher values between 1200 and 1450. Thereafter, a decrease is observed until a minimum is reached at about 1650. Low values are observed until 1750. From then onwards the delta(13)C values increase again, followed by a sharp decline since around 1900.Local historical, glaciological, dendrochronological and icecore data suggest that the isotope values mirror a climatic signal between 1200 and 1900. The negative trend in the 20th century can probably be attributed to species specific physiological reactions induced by the anthropogeniocally elevated CO2 concentration.Since the tree rings of some time periods are extremely narrow, always 5 tree rings had to be combined. Because of this sampling procedure (pentad sequences) at present the 50 years of instrumentally measured meterological data could not be correlated to the corresponding delta(13)C record.\n",

To what extent does climatic variability affect tree ring growth? Could mountain pine upward expansion contribute to loss of biodiversity in the undisturbed tree line ecotone on the Majella massif?LocationMajella National Park, Apennines, Italy.MethodsDendroclimatological analysis was performed to examine the relationship between tree rings of mountain pine and climatic parameters at the tree line. Climate-growth relationships were analysed using correlation function (CF) analysis and moving CF (MCF).ResultsIn the Majella massif, climate variables affected mountain pine tree growth at the tree line ecotone. Significant correlations were found with spring temperatures and summer precipitation. Essentially, three months played a key role in mountain pine growth: April and May of the current year and October of the previous year. MCF showed that mountain pine is a sensitive species, in terms of tree ring growth.ConclusionsGrowing above the limit of tree vegetation, mountain pine proved to be a promising species for monitoring climate- and land use-driven influences over tree ring growth at high elevations. Our results show that mountain pine is particularly sensitive to climate at the beginning and at the end of the growing season.\n",

      "Rapid 21st-century climate change may lead to large population decreases and extinction in tropical montane cloud forest species in the Andes. While prior research has focused on species migrations per se, ecotones may respond to different environmental factors than species. Even if species can migrate in response to climate change, if ecotones do not they can function as hard barriers to species migrations, making ecotone migrations central to understanding species persistence under scenarios of climate change. We examined a 42-year span of aerial photographs and high resolution satellite imagery to calculate migration rates of timberline-the grassland-forest ecotone-inside and outside of protected areas in the high Peruvian Andes. We found that timberline in protected areas was more likely to migrate upward in elevation than in areas with frequent cattle grazing and fire. However, rates in both protected (0.24 m yr(-1)) and unprotected (0.05 m yr(-1)) areas are only 0.5-2.3% of the rates needed to stay in equilibrium with projected climate by 2100. These ecotone migration rates are 12.5 to 110 times slower than the observed species migration rates within the same forest, suggesting a barrier to migration for mid-and high-elevation species. We anticipate that the ecotone will be a hard barrier to migration under future climate change, leading to drastic population and biodiversity losses in the region unless intensive management steps are taken.\n",

      "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas. Mitigating N2O emission is critical for combating global climate change and improving the ecological environment. Many studies have focused on factors affecting N2O emission from agricultural soils, but rarely on the relationship among these factors. In the present study, continuous measurement on N2O emission was conducted in a maize system in Griffith, Australia and the relationships between N2O emission, soil properties and weather conditions were examined. Principal component analysis and path analysis were used to analyze these data in correlation coefficient and the direct and indirect effects to N2O emission. Results indicated that (1) the major factors affecting N2O emission were WFPS, mineralized nitrogen (Mineral N), daily mean temperature (T-mean) and CO2 concentration. The factors of direct influence N2O emission were following Mineral N, CO2, WFPS, and Tmean. The indirect influence N2O emission was following Tmean, WFPS, Mineral N, and CO2 concentration. (2) The standard multiple regression describing the relationship between N2O emission and its major factors were Y = -37.162 + 0.5267 X-1 + 0.4331 X-2 + 0.3014 X-3 + 0.2392 X-4 (r = 0.924, p < 0.01, n = 151), where Y is N2O emission, X-1 is Mineral N, X-2 is CO2, X-3 is WFPS and X-4 is T-mean. (3) N2O emission from agricultural soils can be monitored and mitigated through improved management practices such as irrigation, straw retention and fertilizer application.

      "Pressure buildup limits CO2 injectivity and storage capacity and pressure loss limits the brine production capacity and security, particularly for closed and semi-closed formations. In this study, we conduct a multiwell model to examine the potential advantages of combined exhaustive brine production and complete CO2 storage in deep saline formations in the Jiangling Depression, Jianghan Basin of China. Simulation results show that the simultaneous brine extraction and CO2 storage in saline formation not only effectively regulate near-wellbore and regional pressure of storage formation, but also can significantly enhance brine production capacity and CO2 injectivity as well as storage capacity, thereby achieving maximum utilization of underground space. In addition, the combination of brine production and CO2 injection can effectively mitigate the leakage risk between the geological units. With regard to the scheme of brine production and CO2 injection, constant pressure injection is much superior to constant rate injection thanks to the mutual enhancement effect. The simultaneous brine production of nine wells and CO2 injection of four wells under the constant pressure injection scheme act best in all respects of pressure regulation, brine production efficiency, CO2 injectivity and storage capacity as well as leakage risk mitigation. Several ways to further optimize the combined strategy are investigated and the results show that increasing the injection pressure and adopting fully penetrating production wells can further significantly enhance the combined efficiency; however, there is no obvious promoting effect by shortening the well spacing and changing the well placement.

      "Comparisons were made of total and microbial C and N pools and C and N metabolism in litter and mineral soil of a mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forest, ca. 100 m below timberline, and an adjacent tussock grassland (dominated by Chionochloa pallens), ca. 100 m above timberline, in Canterbury, New Zealand. Mean annual precipitation at the sites is ca. 1600 mm and mean annual air temperature ca. 6 degrees C. The silt loam soils are Andic Dystrochrepts. Total C and N and microbial C and N contents in litter and mineral soil (0-50 cm depth) differed appreciably in the two ecosystems and were 1.41, 2.00, 1.71 and 1.98 times, respectively, greater on an area basis at the grassland than at the forest site. Ratios of microbial C-to-total C, microbial N-to-total N and microbial C-to-N generally declined with profile depth. CO2-C production, per unit of total C, and metabolic quotients (qCO(2) values) tended to be greater in mineral soil from the forest than from the grassland. CO2-C production, calculated on an area basis to 50 cm depth of mineral soil, was similar in both ecosystems. Net N mineralization (during 0-56 days at 25 degrees C) was appreciable in the forest litter, but absent in tussock litter; it was similar in both systems at 0-10 cm and 20-50 cm depths of mineral soil, but was lower in the forest than in the grassland at 10-20 cm depth. Nitrification was not detected in the litter samples and was either absent or very low in the samples of mineral soil. Results, overall, show that marked differences in soil and microbial properties can occur in adjacent, indigenous ecosystems in almost the same climatic environment. Although sail microbial biomass levels were lower in the forest than in the grassland, the potential metabolic activity of the component microorganisms tended to be greater in the forest. The relevance of these results to the turnover of organic matter in these ecosystems is briefly discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.\n",

      "Warming and drying is predicted for most of the Mediterranean and other regions, and knowledge of this effect on forest carbon dynamics cannot be easily extrapolated from temperate climates. Instead, we provide quantitative information from a 6-year study in a 40-year old pine forest at the dry \"timberline\" (280 mm annual rainfall) on soil CO2 efflux (F-s) and some of its controlling factors. Annual Fs was relatively low (405.9 +/- 23.8 g C m(-2) a(-1)), but within one standard deviation of a global nonlinear relationship we derived between mean annual precipitation and F-s in forests. Seasonal variations in F-s were dominated by soil temperature (with Q(10) = 2.45) in the wet season, and by soil moisture in the water-limited seasons, but not by pulse responses to precipitation. No temperature sensitivity was observed in the dry season, but there was clear evidence for down regulation of sensitivity to Q(10) = 1.18 when soil moisture was kept high by a supplement summer irrigation treatment. Interannual variations in F-s correlated linearly with cumulative rainwater availability, indicating the combined importance of both precipitation amount and its temporal distribution between the wet (and cool) season and the transitional periods characterized by high evaporative demand. Low rates of soil carbon loss combined with high belowground carbon allocation (41% of canopy CO2 uptake) might explain the high soil organic carbon accumulation and net ecosystem productivity in this dry forest. Our results indicate that F-s in pine forests may adjust to dry conditions with better carbon economy than estimated from response to episodic drought in more temperate climate.\n",

      "Based on the principles of the probability theory a statistical model has been developed assessing the likelihood of occurrence of extreme temperature events from the knowledge of the statistical characteristics of the daily temperature extremes. It is demonstrated that the probability of such events is more sensitive to changes in the variability of climate than to changes in its average. Further, this sensitivity increases at a nonlinear rate the more extreme the event. The applicability of the model has been verified by comparing the simulated frequencies of a large spectrum of temperature events with the observed numbers derived from a long time series of daily temperature extremes at Potsdam. Accordingly, the relative simulation errors increase significantly as the events become more extreme. A correction is possible, because most of these errors are systematic rather than random. Moreover, in accordance with the climate observations the simulations reveal statistically significant linear trends in the number of extreme events since the end of the last century. Local scenarios of extreme temperature events have been derived for the city of Berlin by considering both hypothetical new climate states and climate changes simulated by a General Circulation Model (GCM). As a consequence of an increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases up to the end of the next century according to the IPCC Scenario A the repetition rate of extreme events in summer (e.g., hot days) is expected to rise considerably relative to the current climate. Moreover, in the winter season cold days will become extremely rare.\n",

Our records suggest that during the early Holocene vegetation was rather open on the plateau (eg, heaths of Dryas octopetala, Juniperus nana). The only tree that was able to build major stands was Belula. Other timberline trees (eg, Pinus cembra and Larix) expanded in the catchment of the lake after 8200 cal. BP, when Abies alha expanded at lower elevation. The late appearance of these timberline trees contrasts with previous plant-macrofossil records in the region, which show that the timberline had reached elevations up to at least 2350 in already at I 1000 cal. BP. We suggest that local climatic conditions may have delayed the expansion of closed stands of coniferous trees in the catchment of Lac de Fully until C. 8200 cal. BP, when climate shifted to more humid and less continental conditions. After c. 4600 cal. BP vegetation around the lake primarily responded to human impact, which caused a local lowering of the timberline by at least 150 in.\n",

      "The classification of small catchments with respect to low flow risk is needed by water and environmental managers to plan adaptation measures for freshwater streams. In this study a new approach is presented to assess the risk of seasonal low flow in the Pleistocene landscape of the Federal State of Brandenburg in Germany. Seasonal low flow and drought in small streams is very common in this region and is predicted to increase due to climate change within the next decades. Data of 15 years (1991-2006) of daily discharge at 37 small catchments (<500 km(2)) and rainfall data from the same region were used. Principal component analyses were applied to the two data sets separately.The first five principal components of the discharge data, principal components of a precipitation data set covering the same catchments and catchment characteristics were used to explain the patterns found. The first five discharge components explained 72.9% of the total variance in the data set. The first component reflected the general regional discharge pattern. Components 2 and 3 of the discharge data could be related to spatial patterns of precipitation. Components 4 and 5 of the discharge data reflected geohydrologic processes within the catchments. In order to identify catchments with high risk with respect to low flows, component three and five were important as they both identified catchments with faster decrease of flows during summer. These components were used to estimate low flow risk. Catchments located in the northeast of Brandenburg, especially those in the Barnim highlands north and east of Berlin, were identified to be prone to seasonal low flow. There water management measures to adapt to climate change are needed the most. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in saline aquifers is seen as the option with the most potential to achieve substantial CO2 reductions at acceptable cost levels over the next few decades. In Ketzin (near Berlin, Germany), a R&D project has developed an in-situ laboratory for CO2 storage. To properly investigate the implications for the spatial spread of potential leakages, a specific shallow hydrogeological model using the code MODFLOW and the software PMWin was set up. The aim is to investigate the regional near-surface groundwater flow system and its (possible) connection to deeper saline aquifers situated about 150 m below ground level. The model is based on an extensive mapping of the Quaternary to Tertiary formations and the aquifer/aquitard system, comprising an area of approximately 400 km(2). Modelling in the Ketzin area creates glimpses into the hydraulic activity of adjacent deep Quaternary incision troughs and the possible motion of water and CO2 into upper aquifers. The general trend of groundwater flow within the Quaternary aquifers is directed to the Havel River, which acts as the main receiving stream. However, the modelling results support observations of a decoupling of the surface and subsurface catchment areas and indicate that there is only a limited direct hydraulic connection from groundwater of the Ketzin area to the Havel River. Information on possible groundwater discharge areas are provided by the modelling and used to optimise surface monitoring programs.\n",

      "Urban temperatures are typically, but not necessarily, elevated compared to their rural surroundings. This phenomenon of urban heat islands (UHI) exists both UHI above and below the ground. These zones are coupled through conductive heat transport. However, the precise process is not sufficiently understood. Using satellite-derived land surface temperature and interpolated groundwater temperature measurements, we compare the spatial properties of both kinds of heat islands in four German cities and find correlations of up to 80%. The best correlation is found in older, mature cities such as Cologne and Berlin. However, in 95% of the analyzed areas, groundwater temperatures are higher than land surface temperatures due to additional subsurface heat sources such as buildings and their basements. Local groundwater hot spots under city centers and under industrial areas are not revealed by satellite-derived land surface temperatures. Hence, we propose an estimation method that relates groundwater temperatures to mean annual land-surface temperatures, building density, and elevated basement temperatures. Using this method, we are able to accurately estimate regional groundwater temperatures with a mean absolute error of 0.9 K.\n",

      "In September, 2006, we found the remains of timber-sized spruce trees (Picea engelmannii) on the floors of melting ice patches at altitudes of 3465-3480 m in the Mummy Range of north-central Colorado. The ice patches occupy northeast-facing recesses in which windblown snow, scoured from a tundra upland to the southwest, accumulates deeply. We hypothesize that the upland was timbered during the early to middle Holocene. Dense forest vegetation intercepted snow, preventing it from blowing to the recesses, and allowing trees to become established there. Neoglacial cooling led to gradual deforestation of the upland, renewed transport and deposition of snow by wind, and death of the ice-patch trees. Radiocarbon dates show that the trees died between 3860 +/- 15 and 3780 +/- 20 C-14 yr BP (c. 4200 cal yr BP). The trunks show decay similar to that of historic log structures built above timberline during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, suggesting that they have been protected by ice for all but a small portion of the past 4200 years. A series of warm summers and dry winters led to their recent emergence. The study illustrates the importance of monitoring glaciers and ice patches for floral, faunal and archaeological remains whenever severe melting occurs.\n",

      "Aggregated consideration of both climate and socio-economic change in a coarse spatial resolution is a central feature for scenario development in global change research. Downscaling of the supposed aggregated changes is a necessary prerequisite for the assessments of global change at the regional scale. The present paper describes the method and results of an approach to develop and to apply scenarios of socio-economic change at a sub-national level, which are consistent with global change scenarios. National and regional models of economic and demographic development are used to regionalise drivers of socio-economic change. Scenario results are subsequently applied in order to analyse the impacts of socio-economic and climatic changes on water management issues in the Elbe river basin. Starting from global IPCC-Emissions Scenarios and taking up their key points, we formulate two scenarios for the German and Czech parts of the Elbe catchment areas. We present a system of demographic and economic models, designed to consistently project socio-economic developments at a national and sub-national level and, thus, to quantitatively illustrate our scenarios. The results show that in a scenario that assumes continued globalisation and emphasis on economic growth, export orientation will result in a comparatively high share of manufacturing. Growth spreads from centres to peripheral regions. Still, at the national level, the increase in population and employment will be modest and create little additional pressure, but water stress will be considerably stronger on a regional basis, namely in metropolitan areas such as Prague, Berlin and Hamburg. In a scenario where economic goals are balanced with ecologic and social ones, growth is weaker and the weight of the service sector increases more rapidly, thus easing the driving forces for overall water demand and pollution. However, as in this scenario regional metropolitan centres develop at the cost of peripheral regions, regional development is more selective and the driving forces for potential water stress will diverge spatially.\n",

      "The diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) is considered an effective policy strategy to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets. For large-scale adoption, however, demand-side oriented policy measures are required, based on consumers' transport needs, values and social norms. We introduce an empirically grounded, spatially explicit, agent-based model, InnoMind (Innovation diffusion driven by changing Minds), to simulate the effects of policy interventions and social influence on consumers' transport mode preferences. The agents in this model represent individual consumers. They are calibrated based on empirically derived attributes and characteristics of survey respondents. We model agent decision-making with artificial neural networks that account for the role of emotions in information processing. We present simulations of 4.scenarios for the diffusion of EVs in the city of Berlin, Germany (3 policy scenarios and 1 base case). The results illustrate the varying effectiveness of measures in different market segments and the need for appropriate policies tailored to the heterogeneous needs of different travelers. Moreover, the simulations suggest that introducing an exclusive zone for EVs in the city would accelerate the early-phase diffusion of EVs more effectively than financial incentives only.

      "While CO2 emissions of cities are widely discussed, carbon storage in urban vegetation has been rarely empirically analyzed. Remotely sensed data offer considerable benefits for addressing this lack of information. The aim of this paper is to develop and apply an approach that combines airborne LiDAR and QuickBird to assess the carbon stored in urban trees of Berlin, Germany, and to identify differences between urban structure types. For a transect in the city, dendrometric parameters were first derived to estimate individual tree stem diameter and carbon storage with allometric equations. Field survey data were used for validation. Then, the individual tree carbon storage was aggregated at the level of urban structure types and the distribution of carbon storage was analysed. Finally, the results were extrapolated to the entire urban area. High accuracies of the detected tree locations were reached with 65.30% for all trees and 80.1% for dominant trees. The total carbon storage of the study area was 20,964.40 t (sigma = 15,550.11 t). Its carbon density equaled 13.70 t/ha. A general center-to-periphery increase in carbon storage was identified along the transect. Our approach methods can be used by scientists and decision-makers to gain an empirical basis for the comparison of carbon storage capacities between cities and their subunits to develop adaption and mitigation strategies against climate change.\n",

      "Montane plant species around the globe are predicted to shift their distributions upslope in response to increasing temperatures associated with climate change. In the tropical Andes, which are one of the most diverse and threatened of all biodiversity hotspots, many plant and animal species have already started to shift their distributions to higher elevations in response to warming. However, a variety of biotic and abiotic factors may stabilize Andean timberlines and halt further upslope migrations into the high elevation grasslands (referred to as \"puna\" in southern Peru) above the forest. One possibility is that small forest patches that occur above-timberline throughout the Andes may facilitate forest expansion into newly suitable areas in the puna, yet little is known about the ecology or function of these patches. In this study, we examined seedling recruitment patterns, seed dispersal, and microclimate at the timberline, in and around above-timberline forest patches, and in the puna. The above-timberline forest patches had similar patterns of seed dispersal as the timberline but overal <1% of captured seeds were dispersed 10 m into the puna. At both the patch edges and the forest timberline, seedling abundances were lower in the puna relative to the adjacent forest and forest-puna ecotone. This reduction may be a result of reduced seed dispersal across the forest-puna ecotone and/or decreased germination of dispersed seeds due to the harsh microclimatic conditions occurring in the puna (daily temperature fluctuations are greatly elevated in the puna relative to the forest and frost events are more frequent and severe). While increasing temperatures associated with climate change may ameliorate some of the severe climatic conditions occurring in the puna, it will not directly affect other potential recruitment limitations such as reduced seed dispersal, high levels of UV radiation, and anthropogenic activities (cattle grazing and fires) in the puna. With the reduction of anthropogenic activities, above-timberline forest patches may serve as nucleating foci for future forest expansion into the puna. However, our results indicate that any upslope migration of the timberline into the puna will likely occur at a rate that is slower than what is required to keep pace with warming because recruitment is restricted to a narrow strip along the forest-puna borders. Slowed forest expansion into the puna could act as a barrier to the upslope migration of Andean cloud forest species leading to extreme losses of Andean biodiversity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

      "Some ecological restoration projects include elements of trial and error where new measures are repeatedly tried, evaluated, and modified until satisfactory results are achieved. Thereafter, the resulting methods may be applied on larger scales. A difficult step is judging whether developed \"best-practice\" methods have become reasonably ecologically functional or whether further experimentation \"demonstration\" methods can lead to yet better results. Here, we use a stream restoration project as a case study for evaluating methods and abiotic effects and outlining stakeholder support for demonstration restoration measures, rather than only using best-practice methods. Our work was located in the Vindel River system, a free-flowing river that is part of the Natura 2000 network. The river was exploited for timber floating from 1850-1976, and rapids in the main channel and tributaries below timberline were channelized to increase timber transport capacity. Several side channels in multi-channeled rapids were blocked and the flow was concentrated to a single channel from which boulders and large wood were removed. Hence, previously heterogeneous environments were replaced by more homogeneous systems with limited habitat for riverine species. The restoration project strives to alleviate the effects of fragmentation and channelization in affected rapids by returning coarse sediment from channel margins to the main channel. However, only smaller, angular sediment is available given blasting of large boulders, and large (old-growth) wood is largely absent; therefore, original levels of large boulders and large wood in channels cannot be achieved with standard restoration practices. In 10 demonstration sites, we compensated for this by adding large boulders and large wood (i.e., entire trees) from adjacent upland areas to previously best-practice restored reaches and compared their hydraulic characteristics with 10 other best-practice sites. The demonstration sites exhibited significantly reduced and more variable current velocities, and wider channels, but with less variation than pre-restoration. The ecological response to this restoration has not yet been studied, but potential outcomes are discussed.\n",

      "Historically, the promotion of cycling has been neglected in most German cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants. In the last 15 years, however, some cities discovered the advantages of increasing the cycling share for both life quality and a more sustainable transport system in their cities. This paper focuses on four case studies from the German cities of Munich, Hamburg, Berlin and Frankfurt, and investigates both the development of cycling policies and the changing use of the bicycle as mode of daily transport between 2002 and 2008 in these cities. By analysing policy documents, web sources and national travel data, we show (1) that the often claimed increase of cycling usage in Munich, Frankfurt and Berlin is supported, and (2) identify the implementation and strengthening of policies to promote cycling by the local government as crucial for these successes. These findings are supported by our fourth case study, Hamburg, where we were not able to identify an increased bicycle usage in this time period, where cycling promoting policies were adapted by the local government only in 2008 and, thus, effects can only be expected after 2008. Our findings support that, although local cycling policies are not the only factor for successfully increasing cycling usage, they play a crucial role in the process of increasing cycling use in cities. Both, cycling infrastructure improvements and communication campaigns, initiated, supported and executed by the local government, are key factors for increasing bicycle use in cities.

      "Climate change effects are noticeably evident above the timberline where glacier and permafrost processes and mass movements drive the surface evolution. In particular, the cryosphere shrinkage is deeply changing the features and characteristics of several glacierized mountain areas of the world, and these modifications can also affect the landscape perception of tourists and mountaineers. On the one hand glacier retreat is increasing the interest of tourists and visitors in areas witnessing clear climate change impacts; on the other hand cryosphere shrinkage can impact the touristic appeal of mountain territories which, diminishing their ice and snow coverage, are also losing part of their aesthetic value. Then, to promote glacierized areas in a changing climate and to prepare exhaustive and actual proposals for sustainable tourism, it is important to deepen our knowledge about landscape perception of tourists and mountaineers and their awareness of the ongoing environmental modifications. Here we present the results from a pilot study we performed in summer 2009 on a representative glacierized area of the Alps, the Forni Valley (Stelvio National Park, Lombardy, Italy), a valley shaped by Forni, the largest Italian valley glacier. During the 2009 summer season we asked tourists visiting the Forni Valley to complete a questionnaire. This study was aimed at both describing the features and characteristics of tourists and mountaineers visiting this Alpine zone in summer and evaluating their landscape perception and their ability to recognize climate change impacts and evidence. Our results suggest that the dissemination strategies in a natural protected area have to take into account not only the main landscape features but also the sites where the information will be given. In particular considering the peculiarities of the huts located in the area, such as their different accessibility and the fact that they are included or not in a mountaineering network like that of the Italian Alpine Club. Both these factors can influence the kind of visitors to the area, thus requiring different dissemination strategies. Moreover, differences in the viewpoints from where visitors could watch and understand landscape also have to be considered. Next, in a protected area where climate change effects are evident, the dissemination strategies should be developed in close cooperation with scientists who are analyzing the area and with the support of periodic interviews which could be very useful to evaluate the effectiveness of the applied dissemination methods. Last but not least, the questionnaire should be standardized and distributed in several protected areas, thus permitting useful comparisons and the identification of common solutions for sharing in a friendly way scientific knowledge about climate change and its effects on the environment and the landscape.\n",

      "The carbon isotopic fractionation (epsilon(p)) of the C-37:2 alkenone was analysed for 19 South Atlantic sediment samples from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Our study covers the equatorial and subtropical ocean including the coastal upwelling regions off South Africa, the equatorial upwelling, and the oligotrophic western basins. The results were compared to the Holocene V, records from the respective core locations (Andersen, N., Muller, P.J., Kirst, G., Schneider, R.R., 1999. Alkenone 6 13 C as a proxy for past PCO2 in surface waters: results from the Late Quaternary Angola Current. In: Fischer, G., Wefer, G. (Eds.), Use of Proxies in Paleoceanography: Examples from the South Atlantic. Springer, Berlin, pp. 469-488; Benthien, A., Andersen, N., Schulte, S., Muller. P.J.. Schneider, R.R., Wefer, G., 2002. Carbon isotopic composition of the C-37:2 alkenone in core-top sediments of the South Atlantic Ocean: Effects of CO2 and nutrient concentrations. Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles 16, 10.1029/ 200IGB001433). Generally, alkenone epsilon(p) was lower during the LGM compared to the Holocene. Higher glacial epsilon(p) values were only found in sediments front the Angola Basin and in one sample from the eastern crest of the Walvis Ridge. Considering present understanding of LGM-Holocene changes in surface-water conditions (i.e. nutrient level, primary productivity, phyloplankton assemblages), the observed glacial/interglacial difference in V, indicates that multiple factors controlled the isotopic fractionation in alkenone producing algae depending oil the regional setting. In the oligotrophic areas of the South Atlantic the lower than Holocene glacial epsilon(p) values can be partly explained with a decrease in surface-water PCO2 during the LGM. In contrast, the Holocene to LGM decrease in epsilon(p) values in the coastal upwelling areas as well as in the eastern tropical Atlantic most probably reflects much higher glacial haptophyte growth rates induced by an increase in surface-water nutrient concentrations. The exceptional opposite trend of the epsilon(p) differences in the Angola Basin can be explained by a shift in the phytoplankton community towards a greater dominance of diatoms under glacial conditions, thus leaving less nutrients available for haptophytes. In this way, the isotopic record of alkenones indicate lower haptophyte growth rates during the LGM although other palaeoceanographic proxies point to enhanced productivity and higher nutrient levels.

      "Radial growth variability and response to interannual climate variation of Cembran pine (Pinus cembra L.) were studied in the timberline ecotone on Mt. Patscherkofel (2246 m a.s.l.). The study area, which is in the inner alpine dry region of the Central Austrian Alps, is characterized by a continental climate with minimum precipitation in winter (about 150 turn during December-February) and frequent occurrence of warm dry winds (Fohn) in early spring. The hypothesis that spatial and temporal variability of radial growth is caused by site-related differences in sensitivity to winter stress (i.e., desiccation) was examined by applying dendroclimatological techniques. Ordination methods applied to tree ring time series revealed that spatial variability in radial growth is influenced by the local site factors elevation and slope aspect. Growth-climate relationships were explored using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients and multiple regression analysis. Radial growth at the timberline was positively correlated with temperature in July and was also strongly correlated with mild temperatures in the previous autumn and high precipitation in winter (January-March). At the tree line, temperatures in the previous autumn and precipitation in late winter (March) also controlled radial growth, whereas July temperature was not significantly correlated with ring width. Because previous autumn temperature and winter precipitation were the main growth-determining factors at the timberline and the tree line, and both of these climate variables are known to influence susceptibility of trees to winter stress, the results support the working hypothesis. Analysis of climatic conditions in extreme growth years confirmed the high sensitivity of tree ring growth to precipitation in late winter (March) at the tree line plots. Furthermore, extent of growth reduction and release varied spatially and temporarily, with south- and west-facing stands showing a higher sensitivity to climate variation in the most recent decade (1990s) than the north-facing stand. This aspect-related change in sensitivity to climate may be associated with effects of climate warming on cambial activity.\n",

      "Repeated loss of fine soil particles by dust emission from arable fields caused by tillage operations, decline soil fertility and reduce air quality. The objective of this study was to quantify the diurnal dynamic of topsoil moisture and the connected PM10-emission of 15 different soils from arable fields around Berlin. As typical for the young moraine landscape in NE Germany, soils from glacial (sand and loam dominated), aeolian (silt loam), and fluvial (organic) sediments were selected. Soil samples were placed outside under hot summer and clear sky conditions for 24 h to reproduce the natural dynamic of soil surface moisture, including dew uptake during the night and evaporation during the day. Dynamic of PM10 emissions of all soils were then measured nine times per day in a stationary wind tunnel.Glacial and fluvial sands showed lowest fine dust emission potential (PM10pot) between 89 and 41514 PM10 g(-1) soil, while PM10pot of loess soils were higher (369-1215 mu g PM10 g(-1) soil). During the night, the moisture of all samples increased slightly by dew uptake, and fine dust emissions of soil samples were reduced up to 51% directly after sunrise. Highest average reductions in PM10 emissions were found for glacial and fluvial barns. Some hours after sunrise, all soil samples heated up and quickly dried again. Under minimal moisture conditions, highest fine dust emissions were measured between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Drill cores from the inner-alpine valley terrace of Unterangerberg, located in the Eastern Alps of Austria, offer first insights into a Pleistocene sedimentary record that was not accessible so far. The succession comprises diamict, gravel, sand, lignite and thick, fine grained sediments. Additionally, cataclastic deposits originating from two paleo-landslide events are present. Multi-proxy analyses including sedimentological and palynological investigations as well as radiocarbon and luminescence data record the onset of the last glacial period (Wurmian) at Unterangerberg at similar to 120-110 ka. This first time period, correlated to the MIS 5d, was characterised by strong fluvial aggradation under cold climatic conditions, with only sparse vegetation cover. Furthermore, two large and quasi-synchronous landslide events occurred during this time interval. No record of the first Early Wiirmian interstadial (MIS 5c) is preserved. During the second Early Wiirmian interstadial (MIS 5a), the local vegetation was characterised by a boreal forest dominated by Picea, with few thermophilous elements. The subsequent collapse of the vegetation is recorded by sediments dated to similar to 70-60 ka (i.e. MIS 4), with very low pollen concentrations and the potential presence of permafrost. Climatic conditions improved again between similar to 55 and 45 ka (MIS 3) and cold-adapted trees re-appeared during interstadials, forming an open forest vegetation. MIS 3 stadials were shorter and less severe than the MIS 4 at Unterangerberg, and vegetation during these cold phases was mainly composed of shrubs, herbs and grasses, similar to what is known from today's alpine timberline. The Unterangerberg record ended at similar to 45 ka and/or was truncated by ice during the Last Glacial Maximum. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The Federation of German Industries (BDI) commissioned a study of the '' Economic Effects of Alternative Lifetimes of Nuclear Power Plants in Germany.'' The expert organizations invited as authors were the Power Economy; Institute of the University of Cologne (EWI) and Energy Enivronment Forecast Analysis; GmbH (EEFA), Berlin.The reasons for commissioning the Study include the changed framework conditions (deregulation, CO2 emission certificate trading, worldwide competition for resources), which have altered the energy supply situation in Europe. The findings of the Study were presented to the public by the BDI oil October 26, 2005.The Study deals with two scenarios of extended lifetimes for German nuclear power plants of 40 and 60 years as against the existing regulations with plant lifetimes limited to approx. 32 years.The longer service lives of plants are reflected in reduced electricity generation costs and thus may have a positive influence oil electricity prices.Moreover, there would be additional growth of production together with additional jobs, all of which would add up to nearly 42,000 persons for all sectors of the economy as compared to the basic scenario. Also, CO2 emissions could be curbed by up to 50 million tons of carbon dioxide.The Study offers ample and valid reasons in favor of extending the lifetimes of nuclear power plants. In the interest of general welfare, politics would be well advised to relax the restrictions on plant life in the course of this legislative term.\n",

      "Few stable carbon isotope studies exist from high mountain regions which consider both climatological and ecological influences. This study is the first presenting delta C-13 tree ring records from the subalpine vegetation belt of the European Alps (Lotschental. Switzerland), Pooled late wood samples from several trees (Picea abies) per site were used for studies of spatial site comparisons with respect to altitude (upper timberline valley floor), exposure (NS) and soil Moisture (dry . moist). This investigation aims to assess how much these site conditions influence the climatic signal of delta C-13. The delta C-13 site records (1946-1995 AD, late wood cellulose) show a decreasing long-term trend reflecting the atmospheric delta C-13 decrease during this period. We apply a new method for the correction of this anthropogenically induced CO2 trend which considers changes in the atmospheric WC source value and plant physiological reaction due to changes in the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2. The delta C-13 relationship to all investigated months' climatic parameters I temperature, precipitation, relative air humidity was found to be very strong with highest correlations in July, August, the time of late wood development (maximum r(T) = 0.74, r(PPJ) = -0.75, r(RH) = -0.79). In contrast to tree ring width and density Studies the observed temperature signal is not related to the altitude of the sample sites, The precipitation signal extracted from the carbon isotope time series increases with decreasing altitude and it remains strong at the upper timber line. This indicates the suitability of this isotope proxy for reconstruction of atmospheric humidity. Single extreme events (pointer years) provide stronger and more uniform reactions for dry warm than for cool-humid summer conditions. Furthermore. the sites with moderately dry or moist soil conditions react more strongly and consistently than the extremely dry and moist sites at high elevation. Site exposure influences the absolute delta C-13 values (S-exposure high versus N-exposure low), but does not necessarily obscure the climatic signal of the stable isotope records.\n",

      "This chapter presents the contribution of “chakra,” a traditional agroforestry system, to climate change adaptation and biodiversity conservation in Ecuador’s Amazonian communities. IPCC’s methodology was used for the estimation of carbon sequestration in soil, biomass, and cacao plantations. Carbon levels in multiple systems of land use were measured through temporary plots. Chakra is efficient to adapt to climate change due to higher levels of carbon sequestration and tree diversity in comparison to other forms of land use. Chakra allows for sustainable use of forests by combining cultivation of the Ecuadorian finest aromatic cacao, controlled timber extraction, production of staple food, and conservation of medicinal plants. Chakra enables Amazonian communities to contribute to both food security and well-being and conservation of the region’s high biodiversity. The chapter informs policy makers and communities about the importance of strengthening traditional agroforestry to achieve environmental and social sustainability. The Amazon region is a vulnerable ecosystem, where adaptation to climate change depends on the extent to which the options for land use are compatible with the conservation of biodiversity and the provision of the ecosystem services that sustain local communities’ livelihoods. The chapter provides solid evidence that this might be possible through traditional agroforestry. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.\n",

      "Climate change represents the most important challenge for the international scientific community, for the inherent and irreversible modification brought about in natural ecosystems. International institutions increasingly adopt measures to promote preservation of ecosystems and counteract the social and economical consequences of environmental decline. Here we review the actions undertaken by both the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), aimed to stabilize and reduce concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) in atmosphere, including the Kyoto Protocol that obliges developed countries to provide the political and legal framework to meet the Protocol's expectations. Moreover, it is mandatory for national policies to reduce the occurrence of main risky events, such as landslides, floods, and desertification processes, whose frequency have rapidly risen in the Mediterranean regions mostly susceptible to climatic changes. According to the Kyoto Protocol, each signed party should include, in its annual GHG inventory, information on GHG possibly removed by means of carbon sinks activities such as land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). Italian laws encompass the National System for the Italian Greenhouse Gas Inventory and the National Registry for Carbon sinks. The latter estimates GHG emissions by sources and accounts for their net removal based on sinks of the LULUCF sector that includes forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, and settlements. These compartments in 2008 removed 87.3 Mt of CO<inf>2</inf> from atmosphere while, from 1990 to 2008, the total removal as CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent increased by 34.8%, CO<inf>2</inf> accounting for more than 99% of both total emissions and removals of the sector. Within this frame, carbon sequestration in cultivated soils has become important to add new carbon sinks other than LULUCF. The relation of soil management practices to the increase in soil organic matter is a basic requirement to develop a solid methodology to assess carbon stock changes in soil pool and provide a useful database over the national territory. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

      "Purpose: This study quantified the above- and belowground carbon (C) stocks across a chronosequence of spruce (Picea asperata) plantations established on cutovers and explored the turning point after which the increase in biomass C slowed or biomass C decreased for guiding forest management. Materials and methods: We assessed above- and belowground plant biomass stocks at 11 sites in three regions, representing 12- to 46-year-old spruce plantations established on clear-cut areas in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. Biomass and C stocks of trees, understory vegetation, and forest floor litter were determined from plot-level inventories and destructive sampling. Fine root (&lt;2 mm) biomass and mineral soil organic C (SOC) stock were estimated from soil cores. Tree biomass was quantified using allometric equations based on diameter at breast height (DBH) and height (H). Results and discussion: Plant biomass C stocks in spruce plantations rapidly increased from 12 to 20 years at a rate of 7.8 Mg C ha−1 year−1, but decreased from 25 to 46 years at a rate of 0.79 Mg C ha−1 year−1. SOC stocks in spruce plantations gradually decreased from 12 to 46 years at a rate of 4.4 Mg C ha−1 year−1. Total C stock in the ecosystem remained unchanged for the first 20 years after the planting of spruce on cutovers, because the buildup of C stock in spruce biomass during the first 20 years was offset by the decrease in SOC. From 21 to 46 years after the reforestation, ecosystem C stock even decreased at a rate of 5.2 Mg C ha−1 year−1. The contribution of the understory vegetation, forest floor litter, and fine root to ecosystem C stock was low (&lt;5.0 %) in the spruce plantations. Conclusions: Ecosystem C stock in the spruce forest established on the cutover in the eastern Tibetan Plateau was related to stand age. During the first 20 years, this ecosystem was C neutral. However, aged (20–46 years) spruce plantation ecosystem can be a C source if no management was implemented to revitalize tree growth, promote understory vegetation, and enhance SOC accumulation. © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg\n",

      "Multiple production and demand side measures are needed to improve food system sustainability. This study quantified the theoretical minimum agricultural land requirements to supply Western Europe with food in 2050 from its own land base, together with GHG emissions arising. Assuming that crop yield gaps in agriculture are closed, livestock production efficiencies increased and waste at all stages reduced, a range of food consumption scenarios were modelled each based on different ‘protein futures’. The scenarios were as follows: intensive and efficient livestock production using today’s species mix; intensive efficient poultry–dairy production; intensive efficient aquaculture–dairy; artificial meat and dairy; livestock on ‘ecological leftovers’ (livestock reared only on land unsuited to cropping, agricultural residues and food waste, with consumption capped at that level of availability); and a ‘plant-based eating’ scenario. For each scenario, ‘projected diet’ and ‘healthy diet’ variants were modelled. Finally, we quantified the theoretical maximum carbon sequestration potential from afforestation of spared agricultural land. Results indicate that land use could be cut by 14–86 % and GHG emissions reduced by up to approximately 90 %. The yearly carbon storage potential arising from spared agricultural land ranged from 90 to 700 Mt CO2 in 2050. The artificial meat and plant-based scenarios achieved the greatest land use and GHG reductions and the greatest carbon sequestration potential. The ‘ecological leftover’ scenario required the least cropland as compared with the other meat-containing scenarios, but all available pasture was used, and GHG emissions were higher if meat consumption was not capped at healthy levels. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Assessing mismatches between ecosystem service (ES) supply and demand can provide relevant insights for enhancing human well-being in urban areas. This paper provides a novel methodological approach to assess regulating ES mismatches on the basis of environmental quality standards and policy goals. Environmental quality standards (EQS) indicate the relationship between environmental quality and human well-being. Thus, they can be used as a common minimum threshold value to determine whether the difference between ES supply and demand is problematic for human well-being. The methodological approach includes three main steps: (1) selection of EQS, (2) definition and quantification of ES supply and demand indicators, and (3) identification and assessment of ES mismatches on the basis of EQS considering certain additional criteria. While ES supply indicators estimate the flow of an ES actually used or delivered, ES demand indicators express the amount of regulation needed in relation to the standard. The approach is applied to a case study consisting of five European cities: Barcelona, Berlin, Stockholm, Rotterdam and Salzburg, considering three regulating ES which are relevant in urban areas: air purification, global climate regulation and urban temperature regulation. The results show that levels of ES supply and demand are highly heterogeneous across the five studied cities and across the EQS considered. The assessment shows that ES supply contributes very moderately in relation to the compliance with the EQS in most part of the identified mismatches. Therefore, this research suggests that regulating ES supplied by urban green infrastructure are expected to play only a minor or complementary role to other urban policies intended to abate air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions at the city scale. The approach has revealed to be appropriate for the regulating ES air purification and global climate regulation, for which well-established standards or targets are available at the city level. Yet, its applicability to the ES urban temperature regulation has proved more problematic due to scale and user dependent constraints. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Purpose: The applications of biochar (BC) and polyacrylamide (PAM) may have interactive effects on carbon (C) dynamics and sequestration for improving the soil quality and achieving sustainable agriculture. Relative to BC and PAM, rhizodeposits act as C and energy source for microorganisms and may change the mineralization dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM). No attempt has been made to assess the effects of BC, anionic PAM, or their combination on the decomposition of different aged 14C-labeled rhizodeposits. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the treatments mentioned above on the decomposition of different aged 14C-labeled maize rhizodeposits. Materials and methods: biochar (BC) at 10 Mg ha−1 or anionic PAM at 80 kg ha−1 or their combination (BC + PAM) was applied to soils with/without 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-day-aged 14C-labeled maize rhizodeposits. After that, the soil was incubated at 22 °C for 46 days. Results and discussion: After 2 days of incubation, the total CO2 efflux rates from the soil with rhizodeposits were 1.4–1.8 times higher than those from the soil without rhizodeposits. The cumulative 14CO2 efflux (32 % of the 14C input) was maximal for the soil containing 2-day-aged 14C-labeled rhizodeposits. Consequently, 2-day-aged rhizodeposits were more easily and rapidly decomposed than the older rhizodeposits. However, no differences in the total respired 14CO2 from rhizodeposits were observed at the end of the incubation. Incorporation of 14C into microbial biomass and 66–85 % of the 14C input remained in the soil after 46 days indicated that neither the age of 14C-labeled rhizodeposits nor BC, PAM, or BC + PAM changed microbial utilization of rhizodeposits. Conclusions: Applying BC or BC + PAM to soil exerted only minor effects on the decomposition of rhizodeposits. The contribution of rhizodeposits to CO2 efflux from soil and MBC depends on their age as young rhizodeposits contain more labile C, which is easily available for microbial uptake and utilization. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Purpose: Biochar, the by-product of thermal decomposition of organic materials in an oxygen-limited environment, is increasingly being investigated due to its potential benefits for soil health, crop yield, carbon (C) sequestration, and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Materials and methods: In this review, we discuss the potential role of biochar for improving crop yields and decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases, along with the potential risks involved with biochar application and strategies to avoid these risks. Results and discussion: Biochar soil amendment improves crop productivity mainly by increasing nutrient use efficiency and water holding capacity. However, improvements to crop production are often recorded in highly degraded and nutrient-poor soils, while its application to fertile and healthy soils does not always increase crop yield. Since biochars are produced from a variety of feedstocks, certain contaminants can be present. Heavy metals in biochar may affect plant growth as well as rhizosphere microbial and faunal communities and functions. Biochar manufacturers should get certification that their products meet International Biochar Initiative (IBI) quality standards (basic utility properties, toxicant assessment, advanced analysis, and soil enhancement properties). Conclusions: The long-term effects of biochar on soil functions and its fate in different soil types require immediate attention. Biochar may change the soil biological community composition and abundance and retain the pesticides applied. As a consequence, weed control in biochar-amended soils may be difficult as preemergence herbicides may become less effective. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Biochar has been widely proposed to be valuable in the sequestering of carbon (C) in soil due to its chemical and biological recalcitrance. However, whether biochar could cause soil positive priming effects (PEs), which offset the effects of soil organic C sequestration, has raised a very controversial issue and debate recently. Changed soil properties, like microbial community composition, caused by biochar addition, might induce different primed CO2 following substrate addition, compared to soil which never received biochar. However, this remains largely unknown. This study aimed to understand the substrate-induced PEs in biochar-amended soil and the microbial mechanisms involved. Using 13C analysis, a further 28 days of laboratory incubation was conducted after incorporation of biochar for 431 days of pre-incubation to investigate primed soil CO2 emissions induced by the addition of sucrose and Miscanthus giganteus (Miscanthus), in both biochar free soil (L1) and biochar (produced at 350 and 700 °C)-amended soils (L2 and L3). Biochar-amended soils had larger substrate-induced PEs. Larger primed soil C losses (311 μg CO2-C g−1 soil) were observed following Miscanthus feedstock addition in BC700-amended soil (L3 + Miscanthus), compared to soil without BC700 (193 μg CO2-C g−1 soil) (L3). The changes in soil microbial community composition, indicated by PCA analysis of PLFAs, especially actinomycetes and Gramme-negative bacteria, might be responsible for the larger substrate (Miscanthus and sucrose)-induced PEs observed in biochar-amended soils after 431 days compared to biochar-free soils. © 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg\n",

      "Purpose: Biochar has been considered as a stable-carbon source for improving soil quality and long-term sequestration of carbon. However, in view of ecological environmental feedback and the tightly coupled system of carbon-nitrogen cycling, further attention has shifted to the effect of biochar on soil net nitrogen mineralization (SNNM). Recently, ecological evaluations of biochar were mostly based on laboratory incubation or pot experiments, ignoring external and uncontrollable natural factors. Therefore, the essential characteristics of local environments were not accurately described. Materials and methods: In this paper, a nonlinear stochastic model of SNNM based on least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) was set up to study the effect of biochar on nitrogen cycling in a field experiment. In order to explore this effect in natural conditions, partial derivative (PaD) sensitivity analysis of LS-SVM was firstly proposed, evaluated by the data from a known equation, and then applied to open the “black-box” stochastic model of SNNM. Results and discussion: Comparing with the sensitivity analysis of artificial neural networks (ANNs), the RD values of LS-SVM PaD1 algorithm were almost the same as those of ANNs PaD1 algorithm. However, the RSD values of LS-SVM PaD2 algorithm were closer to the given equation. In the SNNM model, RD values of LS-SVM PaD1 algorithm of initial nitrogen, time, and precipitation were 21, 15, and 14 %, and the biochar RD value was only 0.51 %, implying that biochar did not influence SNNM directly. However, the cumulative RSD of the PaD2 algorithm of biochar with the other factors was 15.05 %, the maximum of the interactions, implying that it could greatly enhance the tendency for SNNM by interacting with other factors. Conclusions: PaD sensitivity analysis of LS-SVM was a stable and reliable data mining method. In the SNNM model, initial nitrogen, time, and precipitation were the main controlling factors of the SNNM model. Biochar did not directly influence SNNM; however, it could greatly enhance the tendency for SNNM by interactions with other factors by decreasing the inhibitory effect of initial nitrogen on SNNM and modifying soil condition to change the effect of other factors on SNNM. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Purpose: Biochar application is deemed to modify soil properties, but current research has been mostly conducted on the degraded land in tropical regions. Using six consecutive years of biochar field trial, we investigated effects of biochar on soil aggregates, structural stability, and soil organic carbon (SOC) and black C (BC) concentrations in aggregate fractions. The findings have important implications in managing soil structure and SOC sequestration in high fertility soils of the temperate areas. Materials and methods: The study had four treatments: control; biochar rate at 4.5 (B4.5) and biochar rate at 9.0 t ha−1 year−1 (B9.0); and straw return (SR). Soil samples were collected from 0–10-cm layer, and aggregate size distribution was determined with the wet-sieving method. Then, the mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates and the aggregate ratio (AR), i.e., the ratio of the &gt;250 μm to the 53–250 μm size were calculated to assess the structural stability. Total SOC and BC concentrations in bulk soil (&lt;2 mm) and separated fractions (i.e., &gt;2000, 250–2000, 53–250, and &lt;53 μm) were measured. Results and discussion: The B4.5 and B9.0 significantly increased macroaggregate (250–2000 μm) and MWD and AR indices relative to the control. Comparing to the SR, the improvements in soil aggregation under biochar treatments were limited. Additionally, more SOC in larger fractions (&gt;2000, 250–2000, and 53–250 μm) and BC in extracted fractions under biochar soils were observed. These results implied that biochar addition enhanced both native SOC and BC physical protection by aggregation. Conclusions: Biochar application is effective in mediating soil aggregation, and thus improves both native SOC and BC stabilization in an intensive cropping system of North China. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "The Golfe d'Arguin offshore of northern Mauritania hosts a rare modern analogue for heterozoan carbonate production in a tropical marine setting. Dominated by ocean upwelling and with additional fertilisation by iron-rich aeolian dust, this naturally eutrophic marine environment lacks typical photozoan communities. A highly productive, tropical cosmopolitan biota dominated by molluscs and suspension-feeders such as bryozoans and balanids characterises the carbonate-rich surface sediments. Overall biodiversity is relatively low and the species present are tolerant against the eutrophic and low-light conditions, the strong hydrodynamic regime governed by ocean upwelling, and the unstable, soft-bottom seafloor with few hard substrata. Here, we describe an ectosymbiosis between the hermit crab Pseudopagurus granulimanus (Miers, 1881) and monospecific assemblages of the encrusting cheilostome bryozoan Acanthodesia commensale (Kirkpatrick and Metzelaar, 1922) that cohabits vacant gastropod shells. Nucleating on an empty gastropod shell, the bryozoan colonies form multilamellar skeletal crusts that produce spherical encrustations and extend the living chamber of the hermit crab through helicospiral tubular growth. This non-obligate mutualistic symbiosis illustrates the adaptive capabilities and benefits from a close partnership in a complex marine environment, driven by trophic conditions, high water energies and instable substratum. Sectioned bryoliths show that between 49 and 97 % of the solid volume of the specimens consists of bryozoan skeleton. © 2013 Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "In an effort to reduce carbon dioxide (CO$$_2$$2) emissions to the atmosphere, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been developed to collect CO$$_2$$2 from emissions generators and store it underground. Recent proposed legislation would limit the volume of emissions generated from power sources, effectively requiring some sources to participate in CCS. Both emissions sources and storage operators require incentives to enter into contracts to capture excess emissions at the source, and transport and store the CO$$_2$$2 underground. As the level of emissions from power plants is stochastic and carryover into future time periods is expensive, we develop a newsvendor model to determine the optimal price and volume of these contracts to maximize the expected profit of the storage operator and encourage the participation of multiple emissions sources. Because the storage operator has a limit on the amount of CO$$_2$$2 that can be injected each month, this limit affects the allocation of the optimal contract amounts between the emitters. The distribution of emissions and relative costs of transportation also influence the optimal policy. In addition to analytical solutions, we present data-driven methods for using correlated emissions data to determine the optimal price and volume of these contracts. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).\n",

      "The ecosystem services provided by the Bangladesh Sundarbans contribute in various sectors especially to the livelihood of the surrounding peoples, but they are often overlooked in the valuation process. This study investigates the significance of ecosystem services on peoples’ lives and how these services are affected by climate change and other factors. Here an economic valuation framework was used to list the ecosystem services provided by this mangrove forest. Direct uses included timber, golpata (Nypa fruticans), honey, beeswax, fish, shrimp larvae and tourism. Indirect uses included carbon storage, protection from cyclones and tidal surges, breeding and nursery grounds for the aquatic species, and biodiversity conservation. This work also found that the ecosystem services were diminished by fresh water flow reduction, overharvesting, sea level rise, salinity increase, poaching, and climate change. In the present context and future scenario, sea level rise will be an important contributor to changes in ecosystem services. But because many factors impact sea level rise, the impact of climate change takes on less importance than many other causes of ecosystem service degradation in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. © 2016, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Micropaleontological assemblages from two lakes located on the Aquarius Plateau in southern Utah were investigated to evaluate changes in vegetation, fire disturbance, and paleoclimate over the last 8600 years. This paper presents reconstructions of Holocene landscape conditions and wildfire dynamics in the subalpine zone of the Colorado Plateau. During the early Holocene, forests on the Aquarius Plateau were dominated by spruce and pine at upper elevations and mixed conifer forests at mid-elevation sites. Fire return intervals were the most frequent of the record, averaging 250 years between burning episodes. Proxy-based reconstructions of the middle Holocene suggest warmer climate conditions relative-to-present with variable moisture availability. During the middle Holocene, the forest zone on the Aquarius Plateau contracted where both lower and upper timberline retreated upslope and down-slope, respectively. Fire frequency was similar to early Holocene though overall charcoal accumulations were reduced. In the late Holocene, forests in the subalpine zone became dominated by spruce, fir, and aspen while at mid-elevation forests dominated by Douglas fir, spruce, and pine established. The most striking result indicates that evidence of fire was essentially absent from the Aquarius Plateau during the late Holocene until the arrival of European settlers to the region c. 1850.

      "Frost indices such as number of frost days (nFDs), number of frost-free days (nFFDs), last spring freeze (LSF), first fall freeze (FFF), and growing-season length (GSL) were calculated using daily minimum air temperature (T-min) from 23 centennial weather stations across Kansas during four time periods (through 1919, 1920-1949, 1950-1979, and 1980-2009). A frost day is defined as a day with T-min < 0 A degrees C. The long- and short-term trends in frost indices were analyzed at monthly, seasonal, and annual timescales. Probability of occurrence of the indices was analyzed at 5 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 95 %. Results indicated a general increase in T-min from 1900 through 2009 causing a decrease in nFDs. LSF and FFF occurred earlier and later than normal in the year, respectively, thereby resulting in an increase in GSL. In general, northwest Kansas recorded the greatest nFD and lowest T-min, whereas southeast Kansas had the lowest nFD and highest T-min; however, the magnitude of the trends in these indices varied with location, time period, and time scales. Based on the long-term records in most stations, LSF occurred earlier by 0.1-1.9 days/decade, FFF occurred later by 0.2-0.9 day/decade, and GSL was longer by 0.1-2.5 day/decade. At the 50 % probability level, Independence in the south-eastern part of Kansas had the earliest LSF (6 April), latest FFF (29 October) and longest GSL (207 days). Oberlin (north-western Kansas) recorded the shortest GSL (156 days) and earliest FFF (7 October) had the latest LSF (2 May) at the 50 % probability level.

      "Alpine forest population dynamics are sensitive to climate change. Response patterns are complex, and it is still unclear as to whether or not population dynamics are species-dependent. In this study, population dynamic patterns for alpine timberline Qilian juniper and Qinghai spruce tree species in the mid Qilian Mountains were determined from approximately 1500 C.E. by applying dendrochronological methods. The results showed that these tree species have different forest population dynamics. The Qinghai spruce recruitment rate was clearly higher than that of Qilian juniper. Furthermore, the temporal population dynamic patterns of Qinghai spruce samples taken at different sites were consistent whereas those of the Qilian juniper samples were not. Qinghai spruce population dynamics were primarily affected by temperature, with positive correlations between temperature and recruitment. By contrast, with the exception of a positive to negative shift in the relationship between temperature and Qilian juniper population dynamics, Qilian juniper recruitment significantly decreased when its density reached a relatively high level. Moreover, a shift in the temperature-recruitment relationship and a decrease in recruitment occurred simultaneously, indicating that Qilian juniper population dynamics were affected by both temperature and density. Species to species differences were also observed when compared with previous studies within the mid Qilian Mountains, confirming the existence of species-dependent population dynamic patterns. Forest recruitment dynamic patterns and tree recruitment-climate relationships may help to provide clues for future studies on forest management, conservation and utilization.\n",

      "Palaeoclimate proxies have shown links between climate changes and volcanic activity. However, not much is known about the impact of volcanic outbursts on growth of lowland trees. We investigate the effect of large volcanic eruptions on the growth rate of trees. The study is based on an unexplored comprehensive database with 1128 samples of long tree-ring width (TRW) chronologies of Quercus robur L and Pinus sylvestris L, correlating with forest net primary production (NPP), originating from three different sites in eastern Germany (Greifswald, Eberswalde and Saxony). This study focuses on trees in rarely examined temperate zones where tree growth is less temperature limited. Growth relationships were compared against 52 large volcanic eruptions known for the last 1000 years. Dendrochronological methods revealed a predominantly negative (60.2%) effect of large volcanic eruptions on the tree-ring chronologies. Nevertheless, also positive (31.7%) and neutral (8.7%) tree growth reactions were detected. In the tree-ring width chronologies of Q. robur and P. sylvestris, we detected a negative influence on tree growth for up to four years after large eruptions. The chronologies of Q. robur revealed a stronger negative response (68.1%) than those of P. sylvestris (53%). However, at the Greifswald site both tree species (79% Q. robur and 73% P. sylvestris) show a negative response in tree growth after every volcanic eruption. Furthermore, the results suggest that volcanic aerosols originating from the Northern Hemisphere cause a greater reduction in tree growth than aerosols being emitted from Southern Hemisphere volcanoes, which might be related to the long distances between trees and volcanoes, as well as the global atmospheric circulation patterns. This study demonstrates that the effects of major volcanic eruptions are less clear in trees from central European lowlands than in trees growing at the altitudinal or latitudinal timberlines.

      "The relationship between apical extension and needle density and the effect of temperature and precipitation on needle density was modelled using data gathered from forty-nine felled sample trees in five stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) located along a latitudinal transect from the Arctic Circle up to the northern timberline. The lengths were measured and needle densities assessed from all annual shoots located above 1.3 metres using the Needle Trace Method (NTM), resulting, on average, in 39-year-long chronologies.The mean overall needle density was 7.8 short shoots per shoot centimetre. Needle-density variation in the measured data was mostly due to within-tree differences. Of the total variance, within-tree variation yielded 46%, between-tree 21%, and between-year 27%. The dependence of needle density on annual height growth was studied by fitting a multilevel model with random stand-, tree- and year-intercepts, the independent variables being tree age and height growth. There was a very strong negative correlation between height growth and needle density, and the proportion of between-year variance explained solely by height growth and age was 50%. The stand-wise residual variations and their correlations with the temperature and precipitation time series were further analysed with cross-correlation analysis in order to screen for additional independent variables. The only possible additional independent variable found was the precipitation of April-May (precipitation of May in the two northernmost stands). When it was added to the multi-level model, the proportion of explained between-year needle-density variance was 55%, but the overall fit of the model improved only slightly.

      "Vegetation provides important functions and services in urban areas, and vegetation heights divided into vertical and horizontal units can be used as indicators for its assessment. Conversely, detailed area-wide and updated height information is frequently missing for most urban areas. This study sought to assess three vegetation height classes from a globally available TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM, 12 x 12 m spatial resolution) for Berlin, Germany. Subsequently, height distribution and its accuracy across biotope classes were derived. For this, a TanDEM-X intermediate DEM, a LiDAR DTM, an UltraCamX vegetation layer, and a biotope map were included. The applied framework comprised techniques of data integration and raster algebra for: Deriving a height model for all of Berlin, masking non-vegetated areas, classifying two canopy height models (CHMs) for bushes/shrubs and trees, deriving vegetation heights for 12 biotope classes and assessing accuracies using validation CHMs. The findings highlighted the possibility of assessing vegetation heights for total vegetation, trees and bushes/shrubs with low and consistent offsets of mean heights (total CHM: -1.56 m; CHM for trees: -2.23 m; CHM bushes/shrubs: 0.60 m). Negative offsets are likely caused by X-band canopy penetrations. Between the biotope classes, large variations of height and area were identified (vegetation height/biotope and area/biotope: similar to 3.50-similar to 16.00 m; 4.44%-96.53%). The framework and results offer a great asset for citywide and spatially explicit assessment of vegetation heights as an input for urban ecology studies, such as investigating habitat diversity based on the vegetation's heterogeneity.\n",

      "Aim To search for differences in the spatial variability of upper and lower elevational distribution limits of tropical ferns, based on the assumption that these are determined to different degrees by biotic and abiotic factors.Location The Yungas biogeographical region, in the Bolivian Andes.Methods From a data base of > 25,000 herbarium records, we analysed the skewness of the elevational distribution of 220 montane pteridophyte species, each with 15 records. Additionally, we compared the spatial variability of upper and lower elevational range limits of ferns in 351 plots of 400 m(2) each along four elevational transects separated by 15-450 km.Results Individual species showed variable elevational distribution patterns, ranging from symmetric to asymmetric, i.e. downward and upward skewed, but overall there was a statistically significant trend towards asymmetric distributions with abrupt upper limits and diffuse lower limits. This trend, however, was almost exclusively due to terrestrial species occurring at and above the current timberline. The analysis of the elevational transects revealed no significant trends.Main conclusions The downward-skewed distributional abundance of terrestrial, open-country ferns near the timberline appears to be a result of the extensive forest destruction that has lowered the timberline in the high Andes by 500-800 m, opening up habitats for a restricted suite of species. Our study shows that a limited number of species can cause a general trend in the overall data set, and that failure to extract these data may result in unsupported conclusions, in our case to assign a greater importance to biotic and abiotic factors in the elevational limitation of plants at lower and upper elevations, respectively.\n",

      "The paper deals with the analysis of the external factor (solar activity, volcanic eruptions) influence on tree growth at the Kola Peninsula, northwestern Russia. Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) tree-ring chronologies collected nearby the northern timberline (68.63N, 33.25E) include the oldest (1445-2005 AD) living pine tree found up to date in the Kola Peninsula. A total of 18 living trees Pinus sylvestris were sampled taking two cores. Tree rings measured with a precision of 0.01 mm by using an image analysis system (scanner and relevant software). The samples were cross-dated using standard dendrochronological practices and the COFECHA program. A negative exponential curve was used to remove the age trend from individual annual ring series prior to construction of the chronology using the ARSTAN modeling. It was shown that the past climatic variations in the Kola Peninsula were fairly strongly connected to solar variability and volcanic activity. A superposed epoch analysis of 18 large (Volcanic Explosivity Index, VEI>5) volcanic events revealed a significant suppression of tree growth for up to 8 years following volcanic eruptions. The data analysis enabled us to get some conclusions on the past climate variations and to demonstrate the relation of global and regional climatic variations in the European North.\n",

      "In most dendroclimatological reconstructions, cores are usually taken from the biggest and oldest trees in a stand. The objective of the present study was to investigate the possible influence of such a subjective sampling technique in climate reconstructions using tree ring data. In order to assess the implications of any influence, the study was carried out in two stands with different site elevations and different climate data was used for one of the sites. Twenty-seven spruce trees from an upper timberline site and 18 spruce trees from a lower montane site were investigated. On both sites, subsets of nine doininant and nine suppressed trees were established on the basis of social status and stem diameter. Four additional subsets were made up of trees from the timberline site. The subsets ''winner\", \"loser\" and \"indifferent\" were based on cumulative basal increment growth, and the subset \"damaged\" only; contained trees with strong stem wood injuries. The climate response of each subset was calculated using bootstrap response functions over the investigation period 1901-1995. Mean monthly temperature and monthly precipitation sums were used as independent variables. For the subalpine site, response function models with measured and modelled climate data were calculated. On the subalpine site, the results indicate significant positive correlation of tree-ring growth to monthly mean temperatures in lune (r = 0.294) and July (r = 0.305), and on the lower montane site, significant negative correlation to June temperatures (r = -0.234). Shifts in the correlation values of single months between the subsets as well as between the models with measured and modelled climate data series were small. The largest difference in the tree-ring growth - climate relationship was found between the subalpine: and lower montane sites. The results reveal that the common sampling strategy in dendroclimotology (oldest, largest and dominant trees) hardly affects the results in annual climate response. The results also confirm that ecological site conditions are the most determining factors in the growth models. The selection of meteorological stations can also affect the results but this is of secondary importance. The social status of the toe is of less importance for tree ring growth compared to site elevation and the weather stations used for the regression model. Thus, restricting sampling to the biggest and oldest trees does not seem to be a major problem for dendroclimatological reconstructions.\n",

      "The resilience, diversity and stability of mountain ecosystems are threatened by climatic as well as land-use changes, but the combined effects of these drivers are only poorly understood. We combine two high-resolution sediment records from Iffigsee (2065m a.s.l.) and Lauenensee (1382m a.s.l.) at different elevations in the Northern Swiss Alps to provide a detailed history of vegetational changes during the period of first pastoralism (ca. 7000-5000cal. BP, 5000-3000 BC) in order to understand ongoing and future changes in mountain ecosystems. We use palaeoecological methods (fossil pollen, spore, microscopic charcoal and macrofossil analysis) as well as ecological ordination techniques and time-series analysis to quantify the impact of fire and grazing on natural mountain vegetation at Iffigsee. Fire was used by Neolithic people to create pastures at timberline and clear forests for arable farming in the valley. This had a significant, long-term effect on the mountain vegetation and a negative impact on keystone forest species such as Abies alba, Larix decidua and Pinus cembra. The mass expansion of Picea abies at ca. 5500cal. BP (ca. 3500 BC) was facilitated by anthropogenic disturbance (fire, grazing and logging) causing an irreversible decline in Abies alba. Temperate Abies alba forests, which existed under warmer-than-today conditions, might be better adapted to projected climate change than today's drought-sensitive Picea abies forests, especially under low anthropogenic disturbance following land abandonment.Synthesis. Human impact for millennia has shaped mountain vegetation in the Alps and still continues to have a large effect on today's species composition and distribution. Fire and traditional pastoralism have the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change, maintain species-rich high-alpine meadows and prevent biodiversity losses.\n",

      "This study examines the relationships between atmospheric influences and grain yields as well as yield components: crop density (ears m(-2)), number of kernels per ear and kernel weight of winter rye. The study uses data of a long-term field experiment at Berlin-Dahlem for the period between 1962 and 1996. The crop density and kernel number of winter rye were positively influenced by warm and sunny weather in autumn. An early start of the sowing season after winter was also important for the satisfactory development of these components. Moderate temperatures prior to the beginning of shooting prolonged the period of spikelet formation and led to an increased number of spikelets and finally to a high number of kernels per ear. The kernel weight was negatively influenced by high temperatures and drought during the ripening stage. This weather situation reduced the duration of the grain filling period and thus the kernel weight. The yield of winter rye increased continuously from the mid 1980s as a result of a higher crop density and kernel number. Probably this is a positive climate change effect.. Particularly the higher temperatures in winter time and an earlier beginning of the growing season seem to be favourable in this context. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The use of solar energy in buildings is an important contribution for the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and harmful emissions to the environment. Solar thermal cooling systems are still in their infancy regarding practical applications, although the technology is sufficiently developed for a number of years. In many cases, their application has been conditioned by the lack of integration between cooling and heating systems. This study aims to evaluate the potential of integrated solar absorption cooling and heating systems for building applications. The TRNSYS software tool was used as a basis for assessment. Different building types were considered: residential, office and hotel. The TRNSYS models are able to run for a whole year (365 days), according to control rules (self-deciding whether to operate in heating or cooling modes), and with the possibility of combining cooling, heating and DHW applications. Three different locations and climates were considered: Berlin (Germany), Lisbon (Portugal), and Rome (Italy). Both energy and economic results are presented for all cases. The different local costs for energy (gas, electricity and water) were taken into account. Savings in CO2 emissions were also assessed. An optimization of solar collector size and other system parameters was also analysed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

The results exhibited that viability of fresh collected seeds were found maximum under TTC (2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) staining method however, it declined under storage condition at 41)C with time. The highest germination percentage (67%) was achieved for the seeds collected from Niti provenance (3662masl) with a mean germination time (MGT) of 28 days, when the seeds were subjected to constant dark conditions at 25 C temperature. Pre-chilling treatment reduced the germination of the seeds. Germination was improved significantly at 25 C temperature under dark and control conditions. The overall findings of the present study highlighted that dark condition is more favorable to the seed germination of B. wills as compared to light and light/dark conditions. The study also showed that optimum temperature (25 C) and dark condition has positive effect on seed germination of B. utilis even without pre-treatments.\n",

      "Most hypotheses about controls over high-altitude forests, including treeline, the elevation for upright woody plants, or timberline, the upper elevation for aggregated forest, suggest that low temperature drives forest dynamics, either through effects on cell division and tree growth or indirectly through frost damage or nutrient availability. However, abiotic factors other than temperature, including water availability, may serve as other important controls at high elevations, particularly for seedlings. To test the hypothesis that the timing and amount of precipitation exerts a strong control over the high-elevation forest boundary on the Wasatch Plateau in central Utah, USA, we conducted a field experiment that manipulated water availability and monitored photosynthesis, growth, and survivorship in Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm. seedlings. Survivorship increased from the driest to the wettest conditions, whereas the timing of precipitation did not explain differences in survival. However, we found that large, infrequent rain events increased maximum photosynthetic flux density compared with small, frequent rain events. Our results highlight the potential role of growing season water availability in limiting timberline expansion below the low-temperature thermal limits of P. engelmannii. As a consequence, the infilling of trees below the treeline in this region in response to climate change is likely to be episodic and driven by multiyear periods of high water availability and frequency that overcome drought limitations.\n",

      "The importance of climate warming on forests is recognized worldwide and has increased attention on the significance of both timberline advance and alpine meadow invasion by forests. Successful seedling regeneration in alpine meadows depends on availability of suitable substrates, or microsites, for seedling establishment. We sought to determine whether wood microsites (i.e., nurse logs), which are regeneration sites in Pacific Northwest subalpine forests, promoted regeneration at timberline-alpine meadow borders. To determine the ecological role of wood microsites, we examined mechanisms forming wood microsites; compared density, survival, and percent nitrogen content of seedlings growing on wood microsites to adjacent soil substrates; and compared substrate moisture, temperature, and percent nitrogen content. Wood microsites, at 13 of 14 randomly selected sites, were characterized by highly decayed downed wood (> 75% decay class five) originating from tree fall (66%), snow avalanches (17%), forest fires (15%), and by human cutting (2%). Although no differences in percent nitrogen content were detected, greater seedling densities, greater seedling survival, higher temperatures, and higher moisture contents were found on wood microsites compared to adjacent soil. We suggest that greater seedling density and seedling survival on wood microsites was associated with factors including heightened moisture and increased temperature. Assuming sustained downed wood input from timberline trees and continued viable seed input, we expect wood microsites will facilitate accelerated alpine meadow conifer invasion via wood microsites associated with climate warming.\n",

      "A deeper understanding of past vegetation dynamics is required to better assess future vegetation responses to global warming in the Alps. Lake sediments from Lac de Bretaye, a small subalpine lake in the Northern Swiss Alps (1780 m a.s.l.), were analysed to reconstruct past vegetation dynamics for the entire Holocene, using pollen, macrofossil and charcoal analyses as main proxies. The results show that timberline reached the lake's catchment area at around 10,300 cal. BP, supporting the hypothesis of a delayed postglacial afforestation in the Northern Alps. At the same time, thermophilous trees such as Ulmus, Tilia and Acer established in the lowlands and expanded to the altitude of the lake, forming distinctive boreo-nemoral forests with Betula, Pinus cembra and Larix decidua. From about 5000 to 3500 cal. BP, thermophilous trees declined because of increasing human land use, mainly driven by the mass expansion of Picea abies and severe anthropogenic fire activity. From the Bronze Age onwards (c. 4200-2800 cal. BP), grazing indicators and high values for charcoal concentration and influx attest an intensifying human impact, fostering the expansion of Alnus viridis and Picea abies. Hence, biodiversity in alpine meadows increased, whereas forest diversity declined, as can be seen in other regional records. We argue that the anticipated climate change and decreasing human impact in the Alps today will not only lead to an upward movement of timberline with consequent loss of area for grasslands, but also to a disruption of Picea abies forests, which may allow the re-expansion of thermophilous tree species.\n",

One is the larch (Larix decidua Mill.) population located at 2300m on elevation (near the timberline) which shows a radial growth increase.

      "The Giant Mountains (Krkonose in Czech), the highest and best known mountains in the Czech Republic, belong to the Sudetes, a chain of middle-mountains shared by the Czech Republic, Poland and Germany. Although the altitude of the highest peak (Snezka) at 1602 m a.s.l. belongs to the middle mountains' size, the uppermost areas of the Giant Mts represent a particular landscape system, which displays balanced affinities to both subarctic and high mountain regions. The Giant Mts played an extremely important role as a biogeographical \"crossroads\" during the Late Glacial and Postglacial changes in Northern and Central Europe. Therefore, there are many alpine and arctic phenomena, such as an alpine timberline, subarctic peat-bogs, snow patches, landslides, snow avalanches, periglacial screes, solifluction, cryoplanation terraces, tom, patterned grounds, and outstanding biotic features (relic species and relic ecosystems). As a result of long-term pluridisciplinary research the landscape of the highest elevation of the Giant Mts has been described as the arctic-alpine tundra. Three zones of the arctic-alpine tundra (cryo-eolian, vegetated-cryogenic and niveo-glacigenic zone) have been distinguished according to the characteristics of the relief, types of patterned ground, climatic factors, and composition of vegetation. However, in spite National Park status the increasing pressure of human activities seriously threatens this unique island of arctic-alpine tundra in Central Europe. The main threats to the Giant Mts' tundra are related to (i) high numbers of visitors with consequent environmental impact; (ii) large plantations of dwarf-pine stands, which disturb recent cryopedologic processes; and (iii) air pollution, together with symptoms of climate change. Therefore, the National Park Administration is implementing monitoring and research of both abiotic and biotic processes, to ensure effective management and conservation of the Giant Mts' arctic-alpine tundra.\n",

      "Pollen and plant macrofossils from eight sedimentary basins on the west slope of the Colorado Rocky Mountains document fluctuations in upper and lower timberline since the latest Pleistocene. By tracking climatically sensitive forest boundaries, the moisture-controlled lower timberline and the temperature-controlled upper timberline, paleoclimatic estimates can be derived from modern temperature and precipitation lapse rates. Pollen data suggest that prior to 11 000 yr B.P., a subalpine forest dominated by Picea (spruce) and Pinus (pine) grew 300-700 m below its modem limit. The inferred climate was 2-5 degrees C cooler and had 7-16 cm greater precipitation than today. Abies (fir) increased in abundance in the subalpine forest around 11 000 yr B.P., probably in response to cooler conditions with increased winter snow. Pollen and plant macrofossil data demonstrate that from 9000 to 4000 yr B.P. the subalpine forest occupied a greater elevational range than it does today. Upper timberline was 270 m above its modern limit, suggesting that mean annual and mean July temperatures were 1-2 degrees C warmer than today, Intensification of the summer monsoon, coupled with increased summer radiation between 9000 and 6000 yr B.P., raised mean annual precipitation by 8-11 cm and allowed the lower limit of the subalpine and montane forests to descend to lower elevations. The lower forest border began to retreat upslope between 6000 and 4000 yr B.P. in response to drier conditions, and the upper timberline descended after 4000 yr B.P., when temperatures cooled to about 1 degrees C warmer than today. The modern climatic regime was established about 2000 yr B.P., when the summer precipitation maxima of the early and middle Holocene were balanced by increased winter precipitation.\n",

This paper presents a theoretical model which captures the equity-efficiency issues involved in these debates. It demonstrates that an efficient allocation of the abatement efforts will be achieved by personalised taxes or by uniform tax applied together with compensations across countries. A numerical exercise which accounts for the controversies about many parameters underlying the negotiation helps deriving some policy-oriented conclusions for the implementation of the Berlin Mandate, and the follow-up of Kyoto Agreement.\n",

      "Rising northern hemispheric mean air temperatures reduce the amount of winter lake ice. These changes in lake ice cover must be understood in terms of resulting effects on lake ecosystems. Accurate predictions of lake ice phenology are essential to assess resulting impact. We applied the one-dimensional physical lake model FLake to analyse past variability in ice cover timing, intensity and duration of Berlin-Brandenburg lakes. The observed ice phenology in two lakes in the period 1961-2007 was reconstructed by FLake reasonably well and with higher accuracy than by state-of-the-art linear regression models. Additional modelling results of FLake for 38 Berlin-Brandenburg lakes, observed in the winter of 2008/09, were quite satisfactory and adequately reproduced the effects of varying lake morphology and trophic state. Observations and model results showed that deeper and clearer lakes had more ice-free winters, later ice cover freezing and earlier ice cover thawing dates, resulting in shorter ice-covered periods and fewer ice-covered days than shallow and less clear lakes. The 1947-2007 model hindcasts were implemented using FLake for eight Berlin-Brandenburg lakes without ice phenology observations. Results demonstrated past trends of later ice start and earlier ice end, shorter ice cover duration and an increase in ice-free winters.\n",

This study reports vegetation ingression and land cover changes in an area of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve in Central Himalaya using satellite imagery of 1986, 1999 and 2004. The topographic map of 1960 was taken as benchmark. The SRTM DEM data was used to extract information on elevation, slope and the aspect. The March 1986 satellite imagery showed snow, glaciers and scree as dominant land cover types with a few dense vegetation patches. The 1999 imagery showed marginal increase in vegetation cover while 2004 imagery revealed >20% increase. in the vegetation cover and drastic reduction in snow cover, thereby showing vegetation ingression in erstwhile snow/ice areas. The elevation contours, overlaid on the 2004 imagery, showed the timberline at 4300 in, the alpine scrub line at 4900 m and the tundra vegetation line at 5300 m above m.s.l.. The topographic map of 1960 showed scrub, scattered trees and timberline between 3900 and 4000 m above m.s.l.. The study indicates rapid recession of glaciers and snow cover and ingression by vegetation probably due to global warming related rise in temperature.\n",

      "Climate change policies in Europe can be characterized by two broad, though certainly not universal, consensuses. The first is that climate change is a serious problem. The second is that we should not do anything serious about it. This paper examines the characteristics of, and pressures on, each of these two consensuses, and explores where the obvious tension that is embodied in them may lead. Four main themes are addressed: (i) development of the scientific debate since 1990, the year in which all the major political declarations in Europe were made and in which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) produced its First Assessment Report; (ii) the international processes that influence national positions: the IPCC itself, and the processes associated with the Convention and the first meeting of the Conference of Parties in March 1995 in Berlin; (iii) the national plans and projections on climate change submitted by countries under the Convention, and what they and other factors indicate about the prospects for national trends and policies; (iv) the role of the European Union and prospects for European-wide policies.\n",

      "Tree-ring data of individual trees show lifelong biological trends as a function of cambial age. The compilation of a tree-ring chronology entails standardization (detrending) of the series. Tree-ring standardization commonly derives detrended series of dimensionless tree-ring data that are devoid of the original growth measurements (millimeter, density). A new method is proposed in this study. This method derives modeled tree-ring growth variations to calculate age-standardized tree-ring chronology that allow comparisons between the absolute growth measurements of different sites, regions, or species and between the absolute growth measurements and environmental factors such as climate variables. The modeled tree-ring growth is simply obtained through ranked transformation of the tree-ring values within the user-defined reference age class (RAC) and all remaining cambial age classes. The chronology is thus presented on the scale of growth measurements of the specific tree's age, instead of dimensionless tree-ring indices. This presentation allows the accurate estimation of both the short- and long-term growth variations. The RAC method used at the timberline sites in northern Finland revealed a nonlinear age-dependent association between mid-summer (July) temperature and Scots pine growth of 0.072 mm/degrees C and 0.014 mm/degrees C for cambial age ranges of 1 to 5 to 226 to 330 years.\n",

      "[ 1] Air mass trajectories in the Southern Hemisphere provide a mechanism for transport to and deposition of volcanic products on the Antarctic ice sheet from local volcanoes and from tropical and subtropical volcanic centers. This study extends the detailed record of Antarctic, South American, and equatorial volcanism over the last 12,000 years using continuous glaciochemical series developed from the Siple Dome A (SDMA) ice core, West Antarctica. The largest volcanic sulfate spike ( 280 mu g/L) occurs at 5881 B. C. E. Other large signals with unknown sources are observed around 325 B. C. E. ( 270 mu g/L) and 2818 B. C. E. ( 191 mu g/L). Ages of several large equatorial or Southern Hemisphere volcanic eruptions are synchronous with many sulfate peaks detected in the SDMA volcanic ice chemistry record. The microprobe \"fingerprinting'' of glass shards in the SDMA core points to the following Antarctic volcanic centers as sources of tephra found in the SDMA core: Balenny Island, Pleiades, Mount Berlin, Mount Takahe, and Mount Melbourne as well as Mount Hudson and possibly Mount Burney volcanoes of South America. Identified volcanic sources provide an insight into the poorly resolved transport history of volcanic products from source volcanoes to the West Antarctic ice sheet.\n",

On average, low and high growth years represent cool and warm average growing seasons. The summer temperatures (June, July and August) affect most on growth, but height and radial growth do have a different set of effective temperature periods. Furthermore, July temperature variation affects stronger height than radial growth.Those years with low height/radial-growth ratio, i.e. relatively higher current year's radial than next year's height growth, do have lower growth and cooler-than-average July temperature whereas those years with high height/radial-growth ratio do have clearly warmer mid-summer temperatures.\n",

      "In order to examine the impacts of both large-scale and small-scale climate changes (urban climate effect) on the development of plants, long-term observations of four spring phenophases from ten central European regions (Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, Munich, Prague, Vienna, Zurich, Basle and Chur) were analysed. The objective of this study was to identify and compare the differences in the starting dates of the pre-spring phenophases, the beginning of flowering of the snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) and forsythia (Forsythia sp.), and of the full-spring phenophases, the beginning of flowering of the sweet cherry (Prunus aviumi) and apple (Malus domestica), in urban and rural areas. The results indicate that, despite regional differences, in nearly all cases the species studied flower earlier in urbanised areas than in the corresponding rural areas. The forcing in urban areas was about 4 days for the pre-spring phenophases and about 2 days for the full-spring phenophases. The analysis of trends for the period from 1951 to 1995 showed tendencies towards an earlier flowering in all regions, but only 22% were significant at the 5% level. The trends for the period from 1980 to 1995 were much stronger for all regions and phases: the pre-spring phenophases on average became earlier by 13.9 days/decade in the urban areas and 15.3 days/decade in the rural areas, while the full-spring phenophases were 6.7 days earlier/decade in the urban areas and 9.1 days/decade earlier in the rural areas, Thus rural areas showed a higher trend towards an earlier flowering than did urban areas for the period from 1980 to 1995, However, these trends, especially for the pre-spring phenophases, turned out to be extremely variable.\n",

      "In 1899, T. C. Chamberlin proposed that the CO2 content of the atmosphere decreased during times of enhanced continental erosion, ultimately resulting in glacial epochs.  He ascribed the increase in the rate of chemical weathering (relative to the rate of supply of CO2 from Earth's interior) to increased orogenic activity and globally higher average elevations, which promoted rapid chemical erosion of silicates.  The oceanic record of strontium isotopes, preserved in marine sediment, supports his suggestion that glacial climates during the Phanerozoic are in part linked to increases in the rate of global chemical erosion relative to outgassing from Earth's interior.  Further, the close correspondence of the major tectonic episodes of the Late Ordovician and Early Silurian, the Devonian, the Carboniferous and Permian, and the late Cenozoic to times of increased continental erosion and glaciation suggests that Chamberlin's hypothesis of the cause of glacial periods should be revived.\n",

      "Located in a relatively dry region and characterized by mainly sandy soils, the German Federal State of Brandenburg (surrounding the capital city of Berlin) is especially vulnerable to climate change impacts (e.g., summer droughts) and cascading effects on ecological systems (e.g., decreasing ground water tables, water stress, fire risk, productivity losses) with socioeconomic implications. Furthermore, a complex interplay of unemployment, rural exodus, and an aging population challenges this structurally weak region. We discuss adaptation measures that are either implemented or planned, as well as research into adaptation strategies to climate change for the sectors forestry, agriculture, and water management as well as in nature conservation in light of socioeconomic and ecological challenges and benefits. In doing so, we adopt a systemic view of Brandenburg where the sectors discussed are seen as subsystems embedded in a larger regional system. This at least partially holarchical approach enables the identification of conflicts between adaptation measures, but also of synergies among the sectors that pertain to successful adaptation to climate change. The insights gained ultimately highlight the need for cross-sectoral, adaptive management practices that jointly target a sustainable regional development.\n",

      "Tree-ring data from timberlines have been widely used to reconstruct past temperature variability. High-quality reconstructions depend on successful calibrations in which tree-ring records are compared with instrumental observations of climatic factors to establish quantitative relationships between tree growth and climate. Climatic data used in the calibrations are mostly from nearby meteorological stations, located generally in the valleys near human settlements of mountainous areas, regardless of whether climatic records at low elevations are representative for the upper timberline. In order to better understand the characteristics of the alpine environment at the upper timberline of blackseed juniper (Juniperus saltuaria) in the eastern side of the Sygera Mountains, southeastern Tibetan Plateau, an automatic weather station was established. We found that the variation in the daily/5-day/10-day/monthly mean temperatures and sums of precipitation on the valley bottom (3000 m a.s.l.) as well as the daily/seasonal sums of precipitation from the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) are highly correlated with the measurements at the upper timberline (4400 m a.s.l.). Thus, the variations of the valley bottom temperature and precipitation records are confident indicators of the conditions at the upper timberline on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and hence can be used for the calibration in the dendroclimatic reconstructions based on timberline tree-ring data. For 5-day mean temperature pooled by individual months, the R(2) values of the regression models>0.60 between the valley bottom and timberline in February-August and October, and <0.40 in December. For 5-day total precipitation, the R(2) values>0.60 in March-July and October-December, and <0.40 in January, February, August and September. This study represents a small step towards fixing problems regarding to dendroclimatic calibrations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,\n",

      "High-resolution pollen analysis at five lakes on an altitudinal transect in Switzerland (Gerzensee, 603 m; Leysin, 1230 m; Regenmoos, 1260 m; Zeneggen, 1510 m; Heremence, 2290 m) focused on the vegetational response to the rapid climatic changes at the end and beginning of the Younger Dryas and to the minor Gerzensee and Preboreal climatic oscillations. An absolute time scale transferred from the Greenland GRIP ice core to the Gerzensee and Leysin records by wiggle-matching the oxygen-isotope stratigraphies facilitates the estimation of pollen influx and rates of change. The climatic warming at the end of the Younger Dryas, indicated by increases in oxygen-isotope values and/or the beginning of organic sedimentation in the lakes, was immediately reflected in the vegetation at all the sites investigated. The time lags at sites situated above the timberline during the Younger Dryas are considered to be migrational lags. At the onset of the Younger Dryas a time lag of several decades occurred between the oxygen-isotope record of climatic cooling and the major response of the vegetation, whereas minor vegetation changes occurred with or without short time lags. Betula reacted earlier to the new environmental conditions (within about 40-50 yr at Gerzensee and within less than 36 yr at Leysin) than Pinus and Artemisia (about 170 yr), suggesting that time lags are due to the ecological requirements of the different taxa. For the Gerzensee and Preboreal oscillations little or no change can be observed in the pollen record from Gerzensee, whereas at Leysin both climatic oscillations produced a statistically significant vegetational response to both climatic oscillations. Generally the vegetation responses to climatic changes are mole pronounced near vegetation ecotones at medium and higher altitudes than in the lowlands. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

      "Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) is unique as the only stone pine in North America. This species has declined 40%-90% throughout its range owing to blister rust infection, mountain pine beetle, fire suppression, and global climate change. However, intact mature and old growth forests still exist in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) at high timberline elevations. This study addresses the urgent need to discover the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi critical to this tree species before forests are further reduced. A study of mature whitebark pine forests across five mountain ranges in the Northern GYE confirmed 32 ECM species of fungi with the pine by sporocarp occurrence in pure stands or by identification of mycorrhizae with ITS-matching. Boletales and Cortinariales (Cortinarius) comprise 50% of the species diversity discovered. In Boletales, Suillus subalpinus M.M. Moser (with stone pines), Suillus sibericus Singer (stone pines), Rhizopogon evadens A.H. Sm. (five-needle pines), Rhizopogon spp. (pines) and a semi-secotioid Chroogomphus sp. (pines) are restricted to the hosts listed and are not likely to occur with other high elevation conifers in the GYE. The ascomycete generalist, Cenococcum geophilum Fr., was the most frequent (64%) and abundant (51%) ECM fungus on seedling roots, as previously reported for high elevation spruce-fir and lower elevation lodgepole pine forests in the GYE. The relative importance of the basidiomycete specialists and the ascomycete generalist to whitebark pine (and for seedling establishment) is not known, however this study is the first step in delineating the ECM fungi associated with this pine in peril.\n",

      "The primary purpose of this publication is to make available two series of historical maps showing 'summer' (April-September mean) temperatures over western Europe from A.D. 1750 and western North America from A.D. 1600.  These maps have been reconstructed using networks of temperature-sensitive tree-ring chronologies as part of a continuing collaboration between the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (FSL) at Birmensdorf, Switzerland and the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, U.K.  The maps were reconstructed using relatively long maximum latewood density chronologies selected from the extensive networks of tree-ring data produced at the FSL.  The reconstructions were produced using a spatial regression technique developed at CRU.The basis for the reconstructions are wood samples from various conifers growing at cool-moist sites close to the alpine or boreal timberlines.  This material was analysed by x-ray densitometry and the resulting maximum latewood density chronologies were calibrated against meteorological data over a 100-year calibration period.These results emphasize the value of dendroclimatological research which can provide continental-scale reconstructions of past climate which represent a potential resource for climatologists, biologists, and historians with an interest in the spatial variability of summer temperatures over the middle to high latitudes.\n",

      "Total stem, branch, twig, and coarse root respiration (R-t) of an adult Pinus cembra tree at the alpine timberline was measured continuously at ten positions from 7 October 2001 to 21 January 2003 with an automated multiplexing gas exchange system. There was a significant spatial variability in woody tissue respiration when expressed per unit surface area or per unit sapwood volume. Surface area related maintenance (R-m) respiration at 0degreesC ranged between 0.109 and 0.643 mumol m(-2) s(-1) and there was no clear trend with respect to tissue type and diameter. Sapwood volume based R-m at 0degreesC by contrast, varied between 2.5 mumol m(-3) s(-1) in the stem and 193.2 mumol m(-3) s(-1) in thin twigs in the upper crown. Estimated Q(10) values ranged from 1.7 to 3.1. These Q(10) values were used along with R-m at 0degreesC and annual woody tissue temperature records to predict annual total Rm. Annual total R-m accounted for 73+/-6% of annual R-t in 2002.\n",

      "Since the 1860s New Zealand mean air temperatures have risen about 0.5-degrees-C, which might be expected to have led to a rise of about 100 m in altitudinal limits of plants. Four tree species were examined at several South Island localities for evidence of such a rise.Young silver beech plants have established above the upper limit of mature trees, mostly within the last 60 years. However, as beech timberlines are strongly buffered, few of these young plants occur more than 9 m from the forest margin. Above mountain beech timberlines, which lie in drier climates east of the Main Divide, the \"advance zone\" is usually less than 7 m wide, and does not include the exposed spurs and northerly faces where timberline ascends highest. Above the limit of mature red beech trees, there is a zone in which younger red beech, up to 150 years old, occur through nearly 30 m of altitude. Scanty data for miro suggest a still wider advance zone.The difference between the potential altitudinal rise of upper limits and that which is actually achieved suggests that in the event of rapid and substantial climatic change, species with intrinsically slow rates of spread would be unable to keep pace. Those with narrow environmental ranges could be threatened with extinction unless managed so as to assist dispersal and establishment.To substantiate the prima facie findings of this study, transects have been set up to monitor long term future changes.\n",

      "At Ketzin, about 25 km west of Berlin (Germany), the saline aquifer of the Triassic Stuttgart Formation is used for a carbon dioxide storage research project. The formation is lithologically very heterogeneous, reflecting a complex fluviatile facies distribution pattern. We focused on the development of a primary geological reservoir model as commonly employed for dynamic modelling during the planning and early injection stages of a storage project. Due to the need to capture the complex geometrical structure of the Stuttgart Formation, despite limited availability of exploration data, stochastic modelling techniques were employed. Firstly, we modelled the facies architecture of the reservoir and, secondly, assigned porosity and permeability values to the facies types included in the model. Petrophysical parameters for each facies type were quantified using site-specific porosity histograms and related permeability functions. The comparison of dynamic flow simulation results and well-test interpretations, and furthermore with the first observed monitoring data, helped to focus the modelling work and to adjust monitoring plans. Modelling is understood as an iterative process, both with respect to data arrival and progressively improving the understanding of the reservoir, but also with respect to the problem which the model is being designed to address.

      "The Ketzin pilot site for geological storage of CO2 in the German Federal State of Brandenburg about 25 km west of Berlin is the only German CO2 storage site and has been the first European pilot site for on-shore storage of CO2 in saline aquifers. Continuous injection of CO2 started on June 30th, 2008, and a total of 61,396 t of CO2 have been injected by September 2012. The injected CO2 was predominantly food-grade with a purity >99.9%, only from May to June 2011, 1515 t CO2 from the Schwarze Pumpe oxyfuel pilot plant with a purity of >99.7% have been injected. The injection is accompanied by a comprehensive operational monitoring program. The program includes continuous measurements of flow rate, fill levels of intermediate storage tanks 1 and 2, outlet pressure and temperature for the injection plant, wellhead pressures (WHP) and casing pressures 1 and 2 for all wells, bottom hole pressure (BHP), bottom hole temperature (BHT) and distributed temperature sensing (DTS) along the injection tubing for the injection well Ktzi 201, BHP for the two observation wells Ktzi 202 (from March 2010 to October 2011) and Ktzi 200 (since October 2011), and above-zone pressure monitoring in shallow observation well P300. This operational pressure-temperature monitoring successfully ensured and proved a safe, smooth and reliable injection operation. A vital part of the operational P-T data comes from the downhole P-T measurements, which are recommended for any CO2 storage site. Without this downhole information, it would not have been possible to provide the complete picture of CO2 injection. The recommended downhole installation design of P-T tools distinguishes CO2 storage from the operational engineering of underground storage of natural gas, where BHP monitoring can be done via WHP recording. The DTS safety monitoring along the injection tubing supported typical operational processes as conditioning of the CO2 and improvement of injection rate and injection temperature and will be beneficial to any CO2 storage project. The above-zone pressure monitoring gives no hints to any hydraulic connection or CO2 leakage through or failure of the cap rock. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Though an outstanding achievement for their time, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps of the eastern Alaskan Arctic nonetheless contain significant errors, and in this paper we address one of them. Specifically, USGS maps of different scale made in the late 1950s alternate between Mt. Chamberlin and Mt. Isto as the tallest peak in the US Arctic. Given that many of the peaks here are close in height and covered with glaciers, recent climate change may also have changed their height and their order. We resolved these questions using fodar, a new airborne photogrammetric technique that utilizes structure-from-motion (SfM) software and requires no ground control, and validated it using GPS measurements on the peaks as well as airborne lidar. Here we show that Mt. Chamberlin is currently the third tallest peak and that the order and elevations of the five tallest mountains in the US Arctic are Mt. Isto (2735.6m), Mt. Hubley (2717.6m), Mt. Chamberlin (2712.3m), Mt. Michelson (2698.1m), and an unnamed peak (2694.9m); these heights are relative to the NAVD88 GEOID12A vertical datum. We find that it is indeed plausible that this ranking has changed over time and may continue to change as summit glaciers continue to shrink, though Mt. Isto will remain the highest under current climate trends. Mt. Isto is also over 100m taller than the highest peak in Arctic Canada, making it the highest peak in the North American Arctic. Fodar elevations compared to within a few centimeters of our ground-based GPS measurements of the peaks made a few days later and our complete validation assessment indicates a measurement uncertainty of better than +/- 20cm (95% RMSE). By analyzing time series of fodar maps, we were able to detect topographic change on the centimeter level on these steep slopes, indicating that fodar can be used to measure mountain snow packs for water resource availability or avalanche danger, glacier volume change, and slope subsidence, as well as many other applications of benefit to society. Compared to lidar, the current state-of-the-art airborne topographic mapping, we found this SfM technique as accurate, more useful scientifically, and significantly less expensive, suggesting that fodar is a disruptive innovation that will enjoy widespread usage in the future.\n",

      "Nicotiana tabacum is the only plant known to synthesise large quantities of anteiso- (3-methyl) alkanes and iso- (2-methyl) alkanes. We investigated the carbon isotope ratios of individual long-chain n-alkanes, anteiso- and iso-alkanes (in the C(29)-C(33) carbon number range) extracted from tobacco grown in chambers under controlled conditions to confirm the pathway used by the tobacco plant to synthesise these particular lipids and to examine whether environmental data are recorded in these compounds. Tobacco was grown under differing temperatures, water availabilities and light intensities in order to control its stable carbon isotope ratios and evaluate isotopic fractionations associated with the synthesis of these particular lipids. The anteiso-alkanes were found to have a predominant even-carbon number distribution (maximising at C(32)), whereas the iso-alkanes exhibit an odd-carbon number distribution (maximising at C(31)). Iso-alkanes were relatively more abundant than the anteiso-alkanes and only two anteiso-alkanes (C(30) and C(32)) were observed.The anteiso-alkanes and iso-alkanes were found to be enriched in (13)C by 2.8-4.3% and 0-1.8% compared to the n-alkanes, respectively, consistent with different biosynthetic precursors. The assumed precursor for the odd-carbon-numbered iso-alkanes is iso-butyryl-CoA (a C(4) unit derived from valine) followed by subsequent elongation of C(2) units and then decarboxylation. The assumed precursor for even-carbon-numbered anteiso-alkanes is alpha-methylbutyryl-CoA (a C(5) unit derived from isoleucine) and subsequent elongation by C(2) units followed by decarboxylation. The ratio of carbon atoms derived from alpha-methylbutyryi-CoA and subsequent C(2) units (from malonyl-CoA) is 1:5 for the biosynthesis of a C(30) anteiso-alkane. The ratio of carbon atoms derived from iso-butyryl-CoA and subsequent C(2) units (from malonyl-CoA) is 4:25 for the synthesis of a C(29) iso-alkane. An order of (13)C depletion n-alkanes > isoalkanes > anteiso-alkanes is evident from compound specific isotope data. This trend can probably be attributed to the ratio of the two different sources of carbon atoms in the final wax components.Higher water availability generally results in more depleted stable carbon isotope ratios due to maximised discrimination during carboxylation, associated with less diffusionai limitation. This was confirmed in the present study by compound specific isotope analyses of iso-alkanes, anteiso-alkanes and n-alkane lipids extracted from the tobacco leaves. Likewise, light intensity has been shown to influence plant bulk delta(13)C in previous studies. The carbon isotope ratios of n-alkanes in tobacco grown under low-light conditions were about 2%, more depleted in (13)C than those of lipids extracted from tobacco grown under elevated light conditions. A similar order of difference is observed for the iso-alkanes and anteiso-alkanes (1.8%, and 1.976, respectively). A negligible depletion in carbon isotope ratios was observed for the iso-alkanes and anteiso-alkanes extracted from tobacco grown under elevated temperatures. These results are consistent with the work of Farquhar [Farquhar, G.D., 1980. Carbon isotope discrimination by plants: effects of carbon dioxide concentration and temperature via the ratio of intercellular and atmospheric CO(2) concentrations. In: Pearman, G.I.

      "Hazard-risk relationships in epidemiological studies are generally based on the outdoor climate, despite the fact that most of humans' lifetime is spent indoors. By coupling indoor and outdoor climates with a building model, the risk concept developed can still be based on the outdoor conditions but also includes exposure to the indoor climate. The influence of non-linear building physics and the impact of air conditioning on heat-related risks can be assessed in a plausible manner using this risk concept.For proof of concept, the proposed risk concept is compared to a traditional risk analysis. As an example, daily and city-wide mortality data of the age group 65 and older in Berlin, Germany, for the years 2001-2010 are used. Four building models with differing complexity are applied in a time-series regression analysis. This study shows that indoor hazard better explains the variability in the risk data compared to outdoor hazard, depending on the kind of building model. Simplified parameter models include the main nonlinear effects and are proposed for the time-series analysis. The concept shows that the definitions of heat events, lag days, and acclimatization in a traditional hazard-risk relationship are influenced by the characteristics of the prevailing building stock.\n",

      "We present here a multiscale modelling approach to predict the current and future spatial distribution of Ring Ouzel (Turdus torquatus) and Blackbird (T. merula) in Switzerland. Species distribution models (SDMs) are applied on three different scales in order to analyse the scale-dependency of predictors that describe the species' realised niche. While the models on the macro- and mesoscales (grid of 100 and 1 km(2), respectively) cover the entire country, our small-scale models are based on a small set of territories. Ring Ouzels occur at altitudes above 1000 m a.s.l. only, while Blackbirds occur from the lowlands up to the timberline. Although both species coexist on the macro- and mesoscales, a direct niche overlap on territory scale is rare. Small-scale differences in vegetation cover and structure seem to play a dominant role in habitat selection. On the macroscale, however, we observed a high dependency on bioclimatic variables that mainly represent the altitudinal range and the related forest structure preferred by both species. Applying the models to climate change scenarios, we predict a decline of suitable habitat for the Ring Ouzel with a simultaneous median altitudinal shift of 440 m until 2070. In contrast, the Blackbird is predicted to benefit from higher temperatures and expand its range to higher elevations. Based on the species distribution models we (1) demonstrate the scale-dependency of environmental predictors, (2) quantify the scale-dependent habitat requirements of Blackbird and Ring Ouzel and (3) predict the altitudinal range shift of both species as related to climate change scenarios.\n",

      "Alpine timberline is a proper indicator of climate change and has received much attention in ecological research during the past decades. In this study, variations of alpine timberlines and their biogeographic characteristics were investigated by a combination of field surveys, climate indices, and soil nutrient analyses in the northern Tianshan Mountains (NTM) of northwest China. The timberline altitudes were probed to range from 2,530 to 2,800 m a.s.l. in the NTM, gradually descending from west to east along the V-shaped Ili valley (from Zhaosu to Xinyuan), and ascending from west to east across the northernmost range of the study area (from Bole to Balikun). The vertical widths between the upper and lower limits of the timberlines were widest in the middle NTM (Kuytun to Changji) and the Ili valley (Zhaosu to Xinyuan). Interactions between the terrain and air currents resulted in variant climates within the NTM, which contributed to significant timberline distribution differences. Although vertical width was positively correlated to soil nutrient (especially organic matter, r = 0.78), and timberline altitudes were positively related to the soil pH values, the temperature during the growing season primarily determines both altitude and vertical width. In conclusion, timberline altitudes were dominated by the combined effects of local topography, soil nutrient properties, water, and thermal conditions. Identifying the dominating influencing factors of NTM timberlines provided potential insights to better understand the effects of climate change on the alpine ecosystem over central Asia.\n",

      "The ability to respond to magnetic fields is ubiquitous among the five kingdoms of organisms. Apart from the mechanisms that are at work in bacterial magnetotaxis, none of the innumerable magnetobiological effects are as yet completely understood in terms of their underlying physical principles. Physical theories on magnetoreception, which draw on classical electrodynamics as well as on quantum electrodynamics, have greatly advanced during the past twenty years, and provide a basis for biological experimentation. This review places major emphasis on theories, and magnetobiological effects that occur in response to weak and moderate magnetic fields, and that are not related to magnetotaxis and magnetosomes. While knowledge relating to bacterial magnetotaxis has advanced considerably during the past 27 years, the biology of other magnetic effects has remained largely on a phenomenological level, a fact that is partly due to a lack of model organisms and model responses; and in great part also to the circumstance that the biological community at large takes little notice of the field, and in particular of the available physical theories. We review the known magnetobiological effects for bacteria, protists and fungi, and try to show how the variegated empirical material could be approached in the framework of the available physical models.(C) Versita Warsaw and Springer- Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

      "We present a warm season (April-September) temperature reconstruction for Asahikawa, north central Hokkaido, Japan for AD 1557-1990. The reconstruction, which accounts for 34% of the temperature variance from 1925-1990, is based on maximum latewood density data from Saghalin spruce (Picea glehnii) growing at timberline (1340-1390 m) at Mount Asahidake, Hokkaido. We only present a high frequency (prewhitened or white noise) version of the reconstruction because there is an unexplained offset in the mean between the actual and estimated temperature data for an earlier period of overlap from 1891-1924. The coldest summer in the reconstruction is 1718, for which the estimated value is 12.89 degrees C, nearly four standard deviations (SD) below the mean. A colder-than-average year is reconstructed for 1641 (13.30 degrees C, nearly 3 SD below mean), following the eruption of Komagatake, Hokkaido which began in July, 1640. The Asahikawa density chronology, shows decadal modes of variation with statistically significant spectral peaks prior to around 1850. A tree-ring width chronology for this same site (AD 1532-1990) is in phase with a tree-ring width record from central Kamchatka prior to around 1850, but out of phase since that time. This pattern suggests, as has been hypothesized for temperature-sensitive tree-ring records from the eastern Pacific sector (Alaska and Patagonia), that a decadal mode of climate variation was more dominant in the Pacific sector prior to about 1850, after which a higher frequency (ENSO-type) mode may have become more pronounced, at least until recent decades. Additional data from the northwestern Pacific is needed to compare to these findings.\n",

      "Mount Kenya is an equatorial mountain whose climatic setting is fairly simple (two rainy seasons in March-May, the Long Rains, and October-December, the Short Rains) though concealing significant spatial variations related to elevation and aspect (part I, Camberlin et al., 2014). This part II is dedicated to the sensitivity of sorghum yields to climate variability in space and time, with a focus on the intra-seasonal characteristics of the rainy seasons. To that aim we use the crop model SARRA-H calibrated for the region and fed with rainfall, temperature, wind speed, humidity and solar radiation data over the period 1973-2001 at three stations located on the eastern slopes of Mount Kenya. The crop model is run independently for the two rainy seasons. Four groups of simulations are conducted by varying the initialization date of the simulation, the sowing dates and the type of soil, in order to test sorghum sensitivity to water availability. Evidence is found that potential sorghum yields are dominantly controlled by variations in seasonal rainfall amounts: mean yields are higher at higher and wetter locations, and are higher during the wettest rainy season and years. However, beyond this apparent simplicity, more complex aspects emerge of the crop-climate relationships. First, the yield-elevation relationship is altered at high elevation due to lower temperature. Second, despite a strong link with the seasonal rainfall amounts, we evidence an underlying role of some intra-seasonal rainfall characteristics such as the number of rainy days (itself mainly determined by the rainy season duration) or the occurrence of long dry spells. Third, unseasonal rains occurring after the end of the rainy season, especially after the Short Rains, play a role in final crop yield. Fourth, variations of climate variables such as solar radiation by modulating the potential evapotranspiration concur to yield variations at the wettest locations.\n",

      "In Europe, most of the alpine timberline ecotone has been altered by human activities and climate change. Hence, mountain forests are of the highest conservation interest. Here, we screened 25 populations of Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) from the Carpathians and the Alps, using a set of ten microsatellite primers to assess the relative conservation value of populations sampled in Polish and Slovak Tatra National Parks, where potential extinction risk is the highest within the Carpathian range. Although endangered, with small and fragmented populations, P. cembra in the Tatra Mts. shows high levels of allelic richness (AR = 5.0) and observed heterozygosity (H (o) = 0.554). Our results suggest that anthropogenic habitat fragmentation has had little impact on DNA variation of Swiss stone pine in the Tatra Mts. However, the effects of changing conditions on the genetic structure may occur with a substantial time delay due to the long life span of P. cembra. Moreover, inbreeding depression may occur in the next generations, since we found inbreeding (F (IS) = 0.063) and elevated coancestry coefficient (theta = 0.062) in all populations. Also a shallow pattern of genetic differentiation between populations was found, indicating recent fragmentation of a common gene pool that formerly occupied a larger range. Therefore, the Tatra Mts. can be considered as a single conservation unit. Based on our results, we suggest possible conservation activities for Swiss stone pine both in Poland and Slovakia.\n",

      "Declines of Alpine black grouse Tetrao tetrix populations have been linked to increasing disturbance by recreation and degradation of breeding habitat due to changes in land-use, especially abandonment of traditional farming practices. Appropriate forest, shrubland and grassland management may mitigate the negative effects of land abandonment. The habitat associations and trophic requirements of brood-rearing Alpine black grouse hens were appraised to inform effective habitat management policies. We measured the abundance, biomass and phenology of arthropods, a key food source for grouse chicks, in eight timberline habitat categories and performed a habitat selection analysis based on radio-tracking data collected from eight brood-rearing hens in the Swiss and Italian Alps. Arthropod biomass differed significantly between habitat categories and peaked in early summer due to a sharp increase of orthopterans (Saltatoria), an essential food source for Alpine black grouse chicks. Open grassland and grassy shrubland yielded the highest arthropod biomass, with Saltatoria dominating the sample. Yet, brood-rearing hens avoided open grassland, opting for a mosaic of grassy shrubland with scattered trees. Chick-rearing hens apparently traded-off food abundance for reduced predation risk, i.e. habitats offering cover for concealment and escape from predators. These specific black arouse breeding habitat requirements inform about habitat management within Alpine timberline ecosystems. Managers should not restore extensive, homogeneous pasturelands. Instead, a complex heterogeneous habitat mosaic, consisting of patches of grassland and shrubland interspersed with scattered coniferous trees should be promoted.\n",

      "A high-altitude lake sediment sequence (Buhaiescu Mare, 1918 m a.s.l.) in the subalpine zone of the Rodna Mountains was analysed through a multi-proxy approach to determine the sensitivity of high mountain habitats to climate, fire and land use changes. The early Holocene regional forests were dominated by Pinus (sylvestris and mugo) and replaced by Picea abies from 9800 cal. yr BP. After an extended hiatus in the profile (c. 9800-4200 cal. yr BP), probably because of the physical removal of sediments through avalanche or high-flow events, P. abies, Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica forests developed after 4200 cal. yr BP. The timberline and treeline reacted sensitively to past changes in climate and human impact. The site was probably situated above the treeline throughout most of the investigated period. However, a treeline ecotone or krummholz zone may have sporadically reached the lake's elevation in the early Holocene. A decline in timberline and treeline elevation was noted during the last 1200 years, and more evidently over the past 200 years, with replacement by subalpine shrubs (Alnus viridis) and alpine herbaceous communities. Because these vegetation changes were associated with an increased prevalence of pollen-based anthropogenic indicators, charcoal particles and abiotic indicators, human-induced fires and clearance and resultant erosion inputs to the lake are implied. Effects of current warming on the altitude range of trees are not yet visible, probably because land use has more strongly contributed to changes in land cover than the climate fluctuations of the last millennium in the Rodna Mountains.\n",

      "It is still unknown if the variation of leaf energy content across altitudinal gradients is caused by varying climatic factors or species replacement. We test whether there is an altitudinal increase in leaf energy properties within a single species, which is mainly due to the decreasing air temperature with altitude. We collected samples for Bergenia purpurascens Engl. (an evergreen herb) at every 10 m in altitude from outside the timberline forest (4320 m) to the hilltop (4642 m) in the Sergyemla Mountains, southeastern Tibet. We measured mass- and area-based leaf construction cost (CCm, CCa) and their components: nitrogen concentration (N-mass), ash concentration (AC), the heat of combustion (HC), and specific leaf area (SLA), as well as leaf lignin concentration (LC) and new leaf dry mass per plant (NLDM). As altitude increased, CCm, CCa, HC, and LC increased. whereas N-mass, SLA, AC, and NLDM decreased. CCm and CCa were positively correlated with HC and LC but negatively with N-mass, SLA, AC and NLDM. CCm, CCa and HC were negatively correlated with mean air temperature. The data indicated that some high-HC constituents like lignin rather than protein contributed to the observed pattern of leaf energy properties. For high-altitude plants, having relatively high leaf CCm and HC can be regarded as a growth strategy for sustaining carbon gain and maximizing nitrogen-use efficiency. Since CC tends to decrease with increasing air temperature, evergreen herbs at high altitude are expected to construct relatively \"cheaper\" leaves in response to global warming.

      "The cogeneration, or the combined production of electric and/or mechanical and thermal energy, is a well-established technology now, which has important environmental benefits and has been noted by the European Community as one of the first elements to save primary energy, to avoid network losses and to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, our interest will be focused on the micro-cogeneration, MCHP (electric power <= 15 kW), which represents a valid and interesting application of this technology which refers, above all, to residential and light commercial users [M. Dentice d'Accadia, M. Sasso, S. Sibilio, Cogeneration for energy saving in household applications, in: P. Bertoldi, A. Ricci, A. de Almeida (Eds.), Energy Efficiency in Household Appliances and Lighting, Springer, Berlin, 2001, pp. 210-221; Directive 2004/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of the 11 February 2004 on the promotion of cogeneration based on the useful heat demand in the internal energy market and amending Directive 92/42/EEC, Official Journal of the European Union (2004)]. In particular, our work group started a R&D programme on micro-cogeneration in 1995: a laboratory, equipped with the most common appliances (washing-machine, dishwasher, storage water heater,...), has been built and some MCHP prototypes have been tested too. In this article, the results of an intense experimental activity on three different micro-cogenerators, one of them made in Japan and in a pre-selling phase, are reported. In a previous paper a detailed analysis of the test facility, with the description of the equipments and the data acquisition systems, can be found [M. Dentice, d'Accadia, M. Sasso, S. Sibilio, R. Vanoli, Micro-combined heat and power in residential and light commercial applications, Applied Thermal Engineering 23 (2003) 1247-1259]. A typical 3-E (Energetic, Economic and Environmental) approach has been performed to compare the proposed energy system, MCHP, to the conventional one based on separate \"production\". In the energetic analysis the amount of primary energy savings provided by micro-cogeneration unit has been evaluated for different types of MCHP units and at various working conditions. Furthermore the evaluation of the equivalent CO, emissions of the compared systems, MCHP and conventional systems, allows to calculate the MCHP potentials to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally the Simple Pay Back approach has been considered to define the economic feasibility of cogeneration in small size applications with the varying of some economic variables (first cost, gas price, operating hours per year...).

      "Although growth limitation of trees at Alpine and high-latitude timberlines by prevailing summer temperature is well established, the loss of thermal response of radial tree growth during last decades has repeatedly been addressed. We examined long-term variability of climate-growth relationships in ring width chronologies of Stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) by means of moving response functions (MRF). The study area is situated in the timberline ecotone (ca. 2,000-2,200 m a.s.l.) on Mt. Patscherkofel (Tyrol, Austria). Five site chronologies were developed within the ecotone with constant sample depth (>= 19 trees) throughout most of the time period analysed. MRF calculated for the period 1866-1999 and 1901-1999 for ca. 200- and ca. 100-year-old stands, respectively, revealed that mean July temperature is the major and long-term stable driving force of Pinus cembra radial growth within the timberline ecotone. However, since the mid-1980s, radial growth in timberline and tree line chronologies strikingly diverges from the July temperature trend. This is probably a result of extreme climate events (e.g. low winter precipitation, late frost) and/or increasing drought stress on cambial activity. The latter assumption is supported by a < 10% increase in annual increments of ca. 50-year-old trees at the timberline and at the tree line in 2003 compared with 2002, when extraordinary hot and dry conditions prevailed during summer. Furthermore, especially during the second half of the twentieth century, influence of climate variables on radial growth show abrupt fluctuations, which might also be a consequence of climate warming on tree physiology.\n",

      "Stable carbon isotopes may serve as useful tracers to monitor the fate and migration of injected CO2 gas in the subsurface. This is true as long as the already present dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) has a different isotopic composition (delta C-13(DIC)) than the injected CO2 (delta C-13(CO2)). After dissolution and turnover of the injected CO2 to DIC, mixture of both sources (delta C-13(CO2) and delta C-13(DIC)) enables isotope and mass balance calculations to quantify the degree of dissolution of the injected CO2 (geochemical trapping). Furthermore, delta C-13(DIC) may be used as a sensitive tool to determine its source, as well as to indicate the arrival of CO2 at observation wells. Isotope measurements from before and after injection of CO2 at the Ketzin site near Berlin are presented here. Before injection bacterial activity, especially in the injection well, was observed. After injection, most of the DIC present originates from injected CO2 and, generally, an inverse trend exists between the expected increase in DIC contents and its corresponding, decreasing isotope signal. The stable isotopic composition of the water (delta O-18(H2O)), however, remained relatively homogeneous throughout the monitoring period. In order to shift the delta O-18(H2O) signal, large amounts of CO2 are expected to be required. In order to verify the results, and to see how the observed trends evolve, further monitoring, including more isotope measurements combined with further biogeochemical data, will be necessary.

      "Proactive management should be applied within a forest conservation context to prevent extinction or degradation of those forest ecosystems that we suspect will be affected by global warming in the next century. The aim of this study is to estimate the vulnerability under climate change of a localized and endemic tree species Pinus cembra that occurs in the alpine timberline. We used the Random Forest ensemble classifier and available bioclimatic and ecological data to model present and future suitable areas for A cembra and estimate its current and future vulnerability. Future projections for years 2020, 2050 and 2080 were simulated using two IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios run under four global climate models.The suitability model described the optimal environmental conditions for P. cembra. Model scores (kappa = 0.77, sensitivity = 0.99 and specificity = 0.80) are robust. The main factors defining the model were Kira's warmth index and summer temperatures. Results show that there is potential for P. cembra to regenerate and persist in currently suitable areas. Future trends analysis suggested a cumulated mean loss of suitable areas of between 53% and 72% for different scenarios. All modeled projections predicted an upslope shift of the optimally suitable A cembra belt and no downslope shift. We discuss environmental factors/plant interactions, the theoretical assumptions behind the model, model strengths and limitations, and we highlight the conservative traits of our analysis. The results suggest that forest management practices will play a fundamental role in the conservation of P. cembra habitats in the Alps. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Empirical climate variability and change studies may be particularly beneficial when they combine a search for dynamic causes with the examination of trends in meteorological variables. By using an air-mass-based methodology, arctic air masses over Latvia were identified for the 1950-2005 period according to the classification used by Berliner Wetterkarte, which defines air mass types by their origin and the extent of continental or maritime influence. The frequencies of maritime, transformed and continental arctic air masses and the class of arctic air masses were examined to evaluate whether and to what extent these account for changes and variations in the surface temperature. Trends in the frequency of arctic air, monthly-average temperature and monthly lowest minimum temperature series at seven observation sites were determined by using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. The results indicate that the frequency of arctic air masses during winter seasons decreased significantly during this period, with the majority of the decrease being associated with maritime arctic air, and that the frequency of the bitterly cold continental arctic air has also demonstrated a decrease. This trend in the monthly frequency of arctic air was the greatest in February. The increase in the winter, near-surface air temperature was partially attributable to a decrease in maritime arctic air mass frequency and, at a seasonal scale, these changes tended to smooth the peaks in the monthly temperature time series.\n",

      "The availability of electric power is an important prerequisite for the development or maintenance of high living standards. Global change, including socio-economic change and climate change, is a challenge for those who have to deal with the long-term management of thermoelectric power plants. Power plants have lifetimes of several decades. Their water demand changes with climate parameters in the short and medium term. In the long term, the water demand will change as old units are retired and new generating units are built. The present paper analyses the effects of global change and options for adapting to water shortages for power plants in the German capital Berlin in the short and long term. The interconnection between power plants, i.e. water demand, and water resources management, i.e. water availability, is described. Using different models, scenarios of socio-economic and climate change are analysed. One finding is that by changing the cooling system of power plants from a once-through system to a closed-circuit cooling system the vulnerability of power plants can be reduced considerably. Such modified cooling systems also are much more robust with respect to the effects of climate change and declining streamflows due to human activities in the basin under study. Notwithstanding the possible adaptations analysed for power plants in Berlin, increased economic costs are expected due to declining streamflows and higher water temperatures.\n",

      "We studied net ecosystem carbon exchange dynamics in a cembran pine (Pinus cembra L.) forest ecosystem at the timberline ecotone of the Central European Alps from October 7, 2001 throughout January 21, 2003. Chamber measurements of CO2 gas exchange of the foliage, woody tissue respiration, and soil surface CO2 efflux Were used to identify the contribution of these components to the net ecosystem CO2 exchange. We scaled these measurements to the ecosystem and computed the annual total of net ecosystem carbon sequestration and total ecosystem respiration.Seasonal variations in net ecosystem carbon exchange dynamics were primarily controlled by the prevailing temperature and irradiance. Annual net primary production estimated for 2002 was 1610 g C m(-2) y(-1) and total ecosystem respiration was 1247 g C m(-2) year(-1). Annual carbon efflux from the foliage, branches, stems, coarse roots, and the soil surface was 273, 846, 45, 50, and 33 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Net ecosystem production was 363 g C m(-2) year(-1), leading to a ratio of net ecosystem production to gross primary production of 0.23, consistent with values reported for temperate coniferous forest ecosystems, but higher than values reported for boreal coniferous forests. Due to low soil temperature and supra-optimal soil water availability soil surface carbon efflux was relatively low and contributed to only 3% to total ecosystem respiration. Nevertheless, our data indicate that timberline associated Pinus cembra forest ecosystems in the Central Austrian Alps act as relative powerful carbon sinks.\n",

      "The effect of temperature and precipitation on the height increment of Pinus sylvestris (L.) was modelled using data gathered from a total of 49 felled sample trees from five stands of Scots pine located along a latitudinal transect from the Arctic Circle up to the northern timberline in Finland. A multilevel mixed effects model and cross-correlation analysis of prewhitened time series was used to analyse the dependence between height increment and monthly meteorological observations. The effect of the mean July temperature of the previous year on height increment proved to be very strong at high latitudes (r > 0.7). The mean November temperature of the year before the previous affected statistically significantly on height increment in the three northernmost stands. There was no correlation between height increment and precipitation in any of the sites. The final height increment model based on all stands included tree age, long-term mean temperature sum of site, and the mean July temperature of the previous year as independent variables. According to the model, one degree's change in July temperature results on average in 1.8 cm change in the next year's height increment. There was a modest but significant polynomial age-effect. The proportion of explained variance (at the year level) was 74%. The July temperature dependence on height increment was shown to be very strong, suggesting a high value of height increment in climate modelling at the tree line.\n",

      "We developed a Faxon fir (Abies faxoniana) tree-ring width chronology at the timberline in the western Qinling Mountains, China. Herein February-July mean temperature was reconstructed for Zhouqu in the western Qinling Mountains back to AD 1650 based on the standard chronology. The climate/tree-growth model accounts for 43.5% of the instrumental temperature variance during the period 1972-2006. Spatial correlation analyses with the gridded temperature data shows that the temperature reconstruction captures regional climatic variations over central and southeast China, and strong teleconnections with the nearby High Asia. There is a good agreement with cold and warm periods previously estimated from tree-rings in Nepal, India and southwest China. The temperature re-construction indicates that there was pronounced cooling in Zhouqu during the Maunder Minimum (late 1600s to early 1700s). The cold period (1813-1827) of the temperature reconstruction coincide with the volcanic eruptions. Significant spectral peaks are found at 56.9, 22.3, 11.4, 2.9, 2.8, 2.6, 2.2 and 2.0 years. The spatial correlation patterns between our temperature reconstruction and SSTs of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans suggest a connection between regional temperature variations and the atmospheric circulations. It is thus revealed that the chronology has enough potential to reconstruct the climatic variability further into the past.\n",

      "This paper analyzes barriers and opportunities for effective adaptation planning in cities. In particular, we focus on the preparation and adoption of adaptation strategies and action plans by urban planners. For this purpose, we develop a two-tier framework of variables influencing decision-making. The framework emphasizes interaction between different commonly discussed categories of barriers (or opportunities) and their sources. We argue that whether or not urban planners take action to foster adaptation to climate change depends on three first-tier variables: information, resources, and incentives. In addition, we point out that each of these variables may itself be a function of a set of underlying second-tier variables, including actor-specific characteristics of the decision-maker, the institutional environment, and the natural and socio-economic environment. Within this framework, we specify barriers and opportunities for effective adaptation planning as hampering or promoting characteristics of these first- and second-tier variables. We apply and test the framework within the context of four case studies carried out in Lima (Peru), Santiago (Chile), Berlin and Sangerhausen (both Germany). We present anecdotal evidence, which we have gained from expert interviews in the cities. Our results indicate that the relevant categories of barriers are mainly the same across developing and developed countries. What differs is their severity. Moreover, we confirm the importance of the institutional context, including barriers and opportunities associated mainstreaming adaptation, multi-level governance and participation. Finally, our analysis reveals barriers that are specific for local or urban adaptation action, such as the strong dependency on the national regulatory framework.\n",

      "Background: Pyrenean timberlines, lowered to various extents through ancient land use, are expected to rise due to abandonment of land use and climate warming.Aims: To provide a comprehensive survey of the timberline in the Catalan Pyrenees, at the landscape, plant community, and tree population levels.Methods: We assessed the present location of timberlines by means of GIS techniques and characterised the treeline ecotone in 12 representative plots, where we took small phytosociological releves ( surface cover type, vegetation structure and species cover) and studied the regeneration of Pinus uncinata ( seedlings and saplings).Results: The potential timberline was mostly found between 2300 and 2400 m a. s. l., with complex variation in these values due to bioclimatic and topographic diversity. Most of the present timberline was found at far lower altitudes than its potential location. Present forests reached the potential timberline about 25% along its total length. At natural or semi-natural treelines, the transition from subalpine forest to open alpine landscapes was relatively sharp. It was formed by the irregular alternation of two or three contrasting plant community types (forest, dwarf-shrub, grassland). Most Pinus regeneration was recorded where vegetation mosaics occurred on a fine scale. The highest numbers of Pinus seedlings and saplings were found emerging from bare ground or litter in small vegetation gaps. Over recent years Pinus recruitment showed very slow growth and a strong limitation in reaching the pole stage.Conclusions: In Pyrenean treeline ecotones situated near to their potential altitudes, recruitment and growth of existing Pinus uncinata seedlings and saplings is unlikely to produce pronounced infilling and thus perceptible changes in high-altitude forest cover.\n",

      "Dendroecological techniques were used to examine the relationships between topographic aspects, climate factors and radial growth of Picea meyeri and Larix principis-rupprechtii in Luyashan Mountains, North-Central China. Four sites were selected at timberline and totally 67 trees and 134 cores were collected. Pearson correlation and regression surface analysis were conducted to reveal the growth-climate relationships. The results indicated that the two species both showed significant negative correlations with temperature during preceding November on the two topographic aspects. On both slope aspects, growth of P. meyeri exhibited significant negative correlations with precipitation in current June, whereas growth of L. principis-rupprechtii showed significant negative correlations with precipitation in preceding September. On north-facing slope, tree growth was limited by low temperature in early growing season, which not shown on south-facing slope. If climate warming continues, L. principis-rupprechtii may be more favored and a reverse between relationships with temperature and precipitation maybe occur in growth of trees. Treeline position on the north-facing slope may possess a greater potential for elevation shifting than the south-facing slope. Our results supply useful information for discussing the potential effect of future climate on the forest growth in North-Central China.\n",

      "We determined the temporal dynamic of cambial activity and xylem development of stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) throughout the treeline ecotone. Repeated micro-sampling of the developing tree ring was carried out during the growing seasons 2006 and 2007 at the timberline (1,950 m a.s.l.), treeline (2,110 m a.s.l.) and within the krummholz belt (2,180 m a.s.l.) and the influence of climate variables on intra-annual wood formation was determined. At the beginning of both growing seasons, highest numbers of cambial and enlarging cells were observed at the treeline. Soil temperatures at time of initiation of cambial activity were c. 1.5A degrees C higher at treeline (open canopy) compared to timberline (closed canopy), suggesting that a threshold root-zone temperature is involved in triggering onset of above ground stem growth. The rate of xylem cell production determined in two weekly intervals during June through August 2006-2007 was significantly correlated with air temperature (temperature sums expressed as degree-days and mean daily maximum temperature) at the timberline only. Lack of significant relationships between tracheid production and temperature variables at the treeline and within the krummholz belt support past dendroclimatological studies that more extreme environmental conditions (e.g., wind exposure, frost desiccation, late frost) increasingly control tree growth above timberline. Results of this study revealed that spatial and temporal (i.e., year-to-year) variability in timing and dynamic of wood formation of P. cembra is strongly influenced by local site factors within the treeline ecotone and the dynamics of seasonal temperature variation, respectively.\n",

      "We describe the spatial structure of two contrasting subalpine Pinus uncinata forest-alpine grassland ecotones located in the Central Pyrenees (Ordesa and Tesso sites) as a preliminary step to infer the processes that produced their spatial patterns. All trees were mapped and measured within 4200 m(2) rectangular plots parallel to the maximum slope and encompassing timberline and treeline. The spatial description of the ecotones was accomplished using several methodologies. Point pattern analysis (Ripley's K) was first used to quantify the spatial pattern of trees using each stem x-y coordinates. Then, surface pattern analyses (Moran and Mantel spatial correlograms) were used to quantify the spatial pattern of tree characteristics across the ecotone (size, growth-form, estimated age). In the Ordesa site, krummholz individuals showed significant and positive spatial interaction with seedlings. In this site, P. unicinata individuals evolved from shrubby to vertical. growth-forms abruptly producing a steep spatial gradient. In the Tesso site, regeneration was concentrated near the treeline and the spatial gradient was gradual. Both ecotones formed similar to 45 m long zones of influence along the slope based on different variables. Wind and snow avalanches seem to be the main controlling factors of the spatial pattern of trees in the sites Ordesa and Tesso, respectively. Our results point out potential different responses of treeline populations to environmental changes according to the spatial pattern. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Several broad-scale climatic oscillations during the last deglaciation are well documented in regions around the North Atlantic Ocean, This paper reviews empirical evidence for these deglacial climatic oscillations from non-coastal North America and discusses implications for testing climatic simulations and for understanding the cause and transmittal mechanisms. Paleoclimatic interpretation of oxygen-isotope records from several small sites in the eastern Great Lakes region indicates a classic deglacial climatic sequence that is comparable with records from Europe and Greenland. The climatic events as interpreted from Crawford Lake oxygen isotopes include the Bolling-Allerod (BOA) warming at similar to 12.700 C-14 BP, a warm BOA at similar to 12.500-10.910 C-14 BP, an intra-Allerod cold period shortly before 11,000 C-14 BP, a cold Younger Dryas (YD) climate reversal at 10,920-10,000 C-14 BP, the Holocene warming at 10,000 C-14 BP, a brief Preboreal Oscillation (PB) at 9650 C-14 BP, and an early-Holocene cold event at 7500 C-14 BP (8200 cal BP). Some of these events were also evident from changes in upland and aquatic vegetation and sediment lithology, The pronounced YD climatic reversal has been documented from pollen records along the ecotones at this time and from glacier readvances in the Great Lakes region, Along the Rocky Mountains from Alberta to Colorado, the YD event is indicated by alpine glacier advance and/or shift in timberline vegetation, In Minnesota and upper New York, early-Holocene climatic instability is also suggested by oxygen-isotope records and/or varve thickness. The regional variations in evidence for the YD and other events in North America suggest that climatic oscillations may have different expressions in paleo-records, depending on geographic location and characteristics of a particular site, The extent and magnitude of these climatic oscillations across North America suggest that these oscillations are an expression of climatic change that was probably widespread rather than locally induced by a nearby glacier. The location of these sites implies that climatic signals were likely carried over the Northern Hemisphere through the atmosphere, as indicated by general circulation models. We hypothesize that the lack of evidence for a cold YD in interior North America west of the Great Lakes region and east of the Rocky Mountains was caused by the trapping of cold arctic air mass north of the Laurentide ice sheet and by uninterrupted northward expansion of warm Caribbean air; this strongly contrasted climate also produced non-analogous biological assemblages, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

      "Technical potentials and economical aspects of integrating the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) process and methane reforming process, especially carbon dioxide methane reforming (dry reforming), were analyzed. First, the detailed fixed and operating costs of the OCM process were reviewed to diagnose the process deficiencies through a comprehensive techno-economic analysis. Next, the experimental data obtained from the mini-plant scale OCM facility constructed in Berlin Institute of Technology were exploited to guide the analysis and screen the conceptual alternatives of the integrated structure. Then, the performance of an adsorption system in the down streaming sections of the individual OCM process as well as in the integrated process was investigated.In such analysis, the detailed model-based representation of the OCM and methane reforming reactors along with the short-cut modeling of the down streaming sections were utilized to highlight the potentials of the alternative integrated structures.Several performance indicators including the level of methane conversion, ethylene yield, the extent of reactor auto-thermal performance, the CO2 emission, hot spot formation, and the fixed and operating costs were studied. Finally the structure of the selected integrated process was reported which resulted in 35% C-2 yield, 40% auto-thermal behaviour, 60% total methane conversion, 90% CO2 recovery, and lower energy consumption than the classic OCM process and encouraging rate of return of investment.

      "Due to climate change, cities need to adapt to changing rainfall and rainwater run-off dynamics. In order to develop an corresponding process based run-off model for pavements, we had to improve the measurement technique to detect run-off dynamics in an appropriate high resolution.Traditional tipping buckets (TB) have a comparable low volume resolution, capable to quantify the highest intensities in a range of expected flows. This results in varying temporal resolutions for varying flow intensities, especially in low resolutions for small flow events. Therefore, their applicability for run-off measurements and other hydrological process studies is limited, especially when the dynamics of both small and big flow events shall be measured.We improved a TB by coupling it to a balance and called it weighable tipping bucket (WTB). This paper introduces the device set up and the according data processing concept. The improved volume and temporal resolution of the WTB are demonstrated. A systematic uncertainty of TB measurements compared to WTB measurements is calculated. The impact of that increased resolution on our understanding of run-off dynamics from paved urban soils are discussed, exemplary for the run-off and the surface storage of a paved urban soil.The study was conducted on a permeably paved lysimeter situated in Berlin, Germany. Referring to the paved surface, the TB has a resolution of 0.1 mm, while the WTB has a resolution of 0.001 mm. The temporal resolution of the WTB is 3 s, the TB detects individual tippings with 0.4 s between them. Therefore, the data processing concept combines both the benefits of the balance to measure small intensities with that of the TB to measure high flow intensities.During a five months period (July to November 2009) 154 rain events were detected. Accordingly, the TB and WTB detected 47 and 121 run-off events. The total run-off was 79.6 mm measured by the WTB which was 11% higher than detected by the TB. 95% of that difference can be appointed to water, which evaporated from the TB. To derive a surface storage estimation, we analyzed the WTB and TB data for rain events without run-off. According to WTB data, the surface storage of the permeable pavement is 1.7 mm, while using TB data leads to an overestimation of 47% due to low volume resolution of the TB.Combining traditional TB with modern, fast, high resolution digital balances offers the opportunity to upgrade existing TB systems in order to improve their volume detection limit and their temporal resolution, which is of great advantage for the synchronization of water balance component measurements and the investigation of hydrological processes. Furthermore, we are able to quantify the uncertainty of flow measurements gained with traditional tipping buckets.\n",

      "The storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in saline aquifers is one of the most promising options for Europe to reduce emissions of green-house gases from power plants to the atmosphere and to mitigate global climate change. The CO2SINK (CO2 Storage by Injection into a saline aquifer at Ketzin) project is a research and development (R&D) project, mainly supported by the European Commission, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, targeted at developing an in-situ laboratory for CO2 storage.The preparatory phase of the project involved a baseline geological-site exploration and the drilling of one injection and two observation wells, as well as the acquisition of a geophysical baseline and geochemical monitoring, in Ketzin, located near Berlin. The target saline aquifer is the lithologically heterogeneous Triassic Stuttgart formation, situated at approximately 630- to 710-m (2,070- to 2,330-ft) depth. A comprehensive borehole-logging program was performed consisting of routine well logging complemented with an enhanced logging program for one well that recorded nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) and borehole-resistivity images, to characterize the storage formation better. A core analysis program carried out on reservoir rock and caprock included measurements of helium porosity, nitrogen permeability, and brine permeability at different pressure conditions.The saline aquifer at Ketzin shows a variable porosity/permeability distribution, which is related to grain size, facies variation, and rock cementation with values in the range from 5 to > 35% and 0.02 to > 5,000 md for porosity and permeability, respectively. On the basis of core analysis and logging data, an elemental log-analysis model for the target formation was established for all three wells. In addition, permeability was estimated using the Coates equation and compared with core data and NMR log-derived permeability, which seems to provide meaningful permeability estimates for the Ketzin reservoir. On the basis of the good core control that guided the petrophysical well-log interpretation in the first two CO2SINK wells, a porosity and permeability prediction by analogy for the third well is appropriate and applicable. The availability of cores was crucial for a sophisticated formation evaluation at borehole scale that characterizes the real subsurface conditions.\n",

      "This paper presents the results of a forest cover analysis over a time span of 150 years in a protected area of Eastern Trentino (Northern Italy), Paneveggio Pale di S. Martino Nature Park. With the aid of GRASS GIS two historical maps (1859 and 1936) and a set of aerial photographs taken from 1945 to 2006 have been analysed, orthorectified and classified with a supervised method, in order to derive a series of forest cover maps. Techniques applied and problems encountered in using heterogeneous material are discussed. The research shows that from 1859 to the present the increase of forest cover is about 25%, due to the reduced impact of forestry and farming. Timberline dynamics have also been considered; an average growth of about 1 m/year has been estimated for the last 150 years and the data have been compared with the timberline cartography and to field surveys. Timberline estimation for recent years appears to be affected mainly by lower human pressure while the relationship with climate changes is difficult to evaluate. Landscape metrics were used to quantify the changes in forest fragmentation and to identify three core areas that have remained unchanged over time. This case study fills a gap of knowledge about the history of forest cover in the area, shows how multi temporal analysis can support protected area management. This study has been requested by the Park managers, a sign t that landscape planners are becoming aware of past landscape importance.\n",

      "The theories about plant nutrition and soil fertility varied widely from the antiquity to the middle of the nineteenth century, with major (Thaer A. 1809. Grundsatze der rationellen Landwirtschaft (1809-1812). Berlin (Germany): Realschulbuch Ed.) or minor (Liebig J. 1840. Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agrikultur und Physiologie. Braunschweig (Germany): Vieweg) importance attributed to soil humus or soil organic matter (SOM). The importance assigned to humus over the past two centuries will be developed in this historical paper. Intensification of agriculture in the twentieth century permitted an important increase in cultivated plant yield of food, fiber, wood, and biofuel production, not only in the northern countries, but also in some southern countries (e.g., India and China) with the emergence of the Green Revolution. However, the question of organic restitutions and the maintenance (or increase) of the SOM stock was, at times, not taken into consideration; consequently, there was a general decrease in SOM stock for many tropical soils. It is now widely accepted by scientists that SOM depletion is one of the major factors leading to degradation of ecosystem services and loss of ecosystem resilience: new alternatives are now necessary for the maintenance and/or increase in plant productivity and production of environmental services by agriculture. Therefore, this paper will also present some recent research in different tropical countries with a focus on agroecological management of tropical soils.\n",

      "Grassland is an important ecosystem type which is not only used agriculturally, but also covers sites which cannot be used for other purposes, e.g. in very steep locations or above timberlines. Prolonged summer droughts in the mid-term future, as are predicted for Central Europe, are expected to have a major impact on such ecosystems. To address this topic, rainfall exclusion via shelters was performed on three grassland sites at different altitudes (393,982 and 1978 m above sea level) in Switzerland. Diurnal drought treatment effects were studied at each study site on a completely sunny day towards the end of an 8-10 week shelter period. Ecophysiological parameters including gas exchange (An, g(s) and intrinsic WOE) and chlorophyll a fluorescence (F-v/F-m, OPSII and NPQ) were considered for several species. The lowland and the Alpine field site were more strongly affected by soil drought than the pre-Alpine site. At all sites, grasses showed different patterns of reductions in stomatal conductance under soil drought compared to legumes and forbs. In addition, grasses were significantly more affected by reductions in assimilation rates at all sites. Time courses of reductions in assimilation rates relative to controls differed between species at the Alpine site, as some species showed reduced assimilation rates at this site in the early morning. Thus, similar rainfall exclusion treatments can trigger different reactions in various species at different sites, which might not become obvious during mere midday measurements. Overall, results suggest strong impacts of prolonged summer drought on grassland net photosynthesis especially at the Alpine site and, within sites, for grasses (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

      "In a high altitude region such as the Silvretta Alps (Switzerland/Austria), past and extant settlement activities are known to have had large influences on the alpine flora and vegetation. The Silvretta Massif harbors more than 230 archaeological sites above 2000 m a.s.l. on a total area of 550 km(2), from the Mesolithic period to Modern Times, but received little attention in these matters up to recently. The Fimba Valley within the Silvretta area - with 47 known archaeological sites (6 prehistoric, 21 from the Medieval and/or Modern Times, 20 undated) located over an area of 62 km(2) - provides evidence of a broad range of former human presence, as well as peat records allowing the reconstruction of Holocene climatic change and anthropogenic impact on past vegetation. Here, we present a high resolution, multiproxy study (including pollen, cryptogam spores, and non-pollen palynomorphs) on a 177-cm-long radiocarbon dated peat core from the Las Gondas Bog in the Fimba Valley (2363 m a.s.l.). Palynological evidence adds and confirms previous dendrochronological results, revealing extensive high Pinus cembra (Arolla pine) stands around the bog at 10,400 cal BP and between ca. 8600-6700 cal. BP, more than 300 altitudinal meters above today's timberline, and belonging therefore to the highest population known for Central Europe. In addition, our palaeoecological results correlate well with the archaeologically known human impact during the Neolithic, Iron Age and Medieval periods. The exploitation of alpine landscape resources (cultivation of cereals in the valleys) and livestock grazing (in the subalpine and alpine areas) has therefore a long tradition going back at least for 6200 years in the Silvretta region.

      "Tropical timberlines are dynamic ecotones influenced not only by climate but often also by human activity. Understanding differences in soils across these boundaries therefore requires explicit consideration of land use. We examined patterns of soil and fine root chemistry at a tropical timberline ecotone in northern Peru nearly three decades after grazing and fire reduction. Soils were collected in forest edge, and grassland habitat on east- and west-facing slopes and evidence of recent grazing, past fire, and shrub presence was recorded in alpine grasslands. We determined concentrations and mass (to 10 cm) of base cations, phosphorus (P), and inorganic nitrogen (N) in soil, as well as total carbon (C), total N, delta C-13, and delta N-13 in soils and fine roots. Calcium and magnesium concentrations and mass, and soil P and fine root N concentrations decreased from forest to grassland. Lower soil P, soil N, and fine root N concentrations were associated with enriched soil delta N-15, indicating enhanced nutrient losses from edge and grassland soils. The stable carbon isotopic composition of soils and fine roots was more enriched in grassland (soil delta C-13 = -24.1%; fine root delta C-13 = -25.1%) compared to forest (soil delta C-13 = -26.1%.; fine root delta C-13 = -28.2%.), except where shrubs were present. In grasslands, topography appeared to influence grazing and shrub expansion; shrubs were more prevalent on the steeper west-facing slopes while cattle dung was found only on the shallower east-facing slopes. The spatially heterogeneous patterns of shrub establishment and surface soil and fine root chemistry across these forest-grassland boundaries provide evidence of legacies of grazing and burning, underscoring the need for further research on land-use legacy effects on belowground processes in tropical timberline ecosystems.

      "For well over a century, scholars from across the social and biological sciences have been trying to understand the origins and spread of agriculture. This debate is often intertwined with discussions of climate change and human environmental impact. Over the past decade, this debate has spread into Central Eurasia, from western China to Ukraine and southern Russia to Turkmenistan, a part of the world often thought to have been largely dominated by pastoralists. A growing interest in the prehistory of Central Eurasia has spurred a new chapter in the origins of agriculture debate; archaeobotanical research is showing how important farming practices in this region were in regard to the spread of crops across the Old World. While early people living in Central Eurasia played an influential role in shaping human history, there is still limited understanding of the trajectories of social evolution among these populations. In March 2015, 30 leading scholars from around the globe came together in Berlin, Germany, to discuss the introduction and intensification of agriculture in Central Eurasia and adjacent regions. At the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin (Deutsches Archaologisches Institut, DAI), these scholars presented novel data on topics covering East, South, and Central Asia, spanning a wide realm of methodological approaches. The present special edition volume deals with a selection of the papers given at this conference, and it marks a significant step toward recognizing the contribution of Central Eurasian populations in the spread and development of agricultural systems over the course of the Holocene.\n",

      "[1] This study examines which part of the observed stratospheric thermal and dynamical changes since 1979 can be attributed to the observed stratospheric ozone (O-3) losses and CO2 increases. Further, the processes are studied that lead to temperature and circulation changes when stratospheric O-3 and CO2 are modified. We compared results from simulations of the Freie Universitat Berlin Climate Middle Atmosphere Model (FUB CMAM) using observed O-3 and CO2 changes with observed trends of stratospheric temperature and circulation for the period 1979-2000 from FUB data and National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalyses. The observed O-3 decrease leads in the FUB CMAM to a global mean stratospheric cooling, which is enhanced in the upper stratosphere by the imposed CO2 increase. While the model is able to reproduce the observed stratospheric cooling in the upper stratosphere, it underestimates the observed trends in the lower stratosphere, particularly in middle latitudes and during Northern Hemisphere (NH) spring. The observed intensification and increased lifetimes of the polar vortices in spring are captured by the model but with smaller magnitude than observed. It is suggested that the observed upper stratospheric temperature trends during the past two decades in low to middle latitudes are caused by radiative effects due to the O-3 and CO2 changes, while the cooling of the polar stratosphere in winter is enhanced by changes in dynamical heating. However, in northern midlatitudes and in Arctic spring, other effects than O-3 and CO2 changes must be considered to fully explain the observed changes in the lower stratosphere.\n",

      "SWIDRAK I., GRUBER A. & OBERHUBER W. 2011. Cambial activity and xylem cell development in Pinus cembra and Pinus sylvestris at their climatic limits in the Eastern Alps in 2007. - Phyton (Horn, Austria) 51 (2): 299-313, with 2 figures.It has been frequently stressed that at distributional boundaries, like at the Alpine timberline and within dry inner Alpine environments, tree growth will be affected first by changing climate conditions. Climate in 2007 was characterized by the occurrence of exceptionally mild temperatures in spring (3.4 and 2.7 degrees C above long-term mean (LTM) at timberline and the valley sites, respectively) with an almost continuous drought period recorded in April and slightly warmer than average temperatures throughout summer (1.3 degrees C above LTM at both sites).We compared temporal dynamics of cambial activity and xylem cell development in Pinus cembra at the Alpine timberline (1950 m a.s.l.) and Pinus sylvestris at a xeric inner Alpine site (750 m a.s.l.) by repeated cellular analyses of micro-cores (n = 5 trees/site). While onset of wood formation in P sylvestris and P cembra differed by about two weeks (12 and 27 April, respectively), maximum daily growth rates peaked on 6 May at the valley site and on 23 June at timberline. At both sites maximum tracheid production was reached prior to occurrence of more favourable climatic conditions during summer, i.e. an increase in precipitation and temperature. Xylem formation ended on 31 August and 28 October at the xeric site and at timberline, respectively.This study demonstrates the plasticity of tree-ring formation along an altitudinal transect in response to water availability and temperature. Whether early achievement of maximum growth rates is an adaptation to cope with extreme environmental conditions prevailing at limits of tree growth needs to be analysed more closely by taking belowground carbon allocation into account.\n",

      "The alpine timberline on Mt. Teide, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Occurs at about 1000 m lower elevation than that of continental mountains of similar latitude. We tested the hypothesis that edaphic and/or climatic drought are major causes for the timberline depression on this high subtropical island. Comparative measurements of soil water content, needle water status, stomatal conductance, carbon isotope signature, and foliar N concentration were conducted in mature trees of the timberline species, Pinus canariensis Chr. Smith ex. DC, along an elevational transect (upper montane forest at 1600 m to the timberline at 2 100 m) in the wet and early dry seasons. The topsoil (0- 10 cm) desiccated completely in the dry season at the timberline but retained a significantly higher soil moisture at 1600 m where cloud cover is frequent. Daily maximal stomatal conductance of pine needles decreased significantly from 1600 to 2 100 in in the wet season which coincided with it higher water vapour saturation deficit of the air and a drier topsoil at 1800 and 2 100 m compared to 1600 m. The delta(13)C value of sun-fit pine needles increased by 4.5parts per thousand, km(-1) from 1600 to 2 100 m, which is a greater increase with elevation than has been found in mountains on continents; this may indicate partial stomatal closure in high elevation pines. Daily minima of needle water potential in the dry season increased from -1.0 to -1.5 MPa at 1600 m to -2.0 to -2.5 MPa at 1800 and 2 100 in. We conclude that mature P. canariensis trees at the timberline are seasonally affected by edaphic and probably climatic drought which contradicts the opinion that drought stress is principally of low importance in alpine timberline environments. However, neither drought nor frost stress are likely to cause a critical reduction in vitality and growth rate of mature pines because the uppermost pine trees grow up to 14 in in height and have a vital appearance. The carbon sink limitation hypothesis is not applicable to the isolated pine trees at the timberline because self-shading and, consequently, lowered root zone temperatures do not occur. We forward the 'multiple limitations at the seedling stage hypothesis' in order to explain the timberline depression as resulting from a failure of P. canariensis to regenerate successfully at high elevations.\n",

      "The similarities in time series recorded at sites which are distant from each other are called teleconnections. In this paper, the loss of such correlations with inter-site distance was investigated for both climatic and dendrochronological data sets, with 70 tree-ring chronologies. A dense network of weather stations was studied in the southeastern French Alps, covering complex climatic gradients over three departments. 78 sites with precipitation data (with a total of 48 756 monthly values), and 48 stations that recorded temperature (with 20 722 monthly mean values) were analysed. In the same area, four coniferous species (mountain pine and stone pine, European larch and Norway spruce) provided 37 ring-width chronologies for high elevation sites near the timberline. Both silver fir and Norway spruce provided a second tree-ring chronology network for 33 different sites at lower elevations.The teleconnections between precipitation series were found to be higher than those observed for temperature over short distances, but the maximum threshold distance was lower (193 km) compared to a positive correlation distance that exceeds 500km for temperature. The maximum temperatures had stronger teleconnections than minimum values (522 km versus 476 km), since the latter are linked more with other site factors, such as slope, exposure and local topography.As expected, the tree-ring chronologies showed weaker teleconnections than the climatic series, with a threshold distance of 374 km obtained for all high elevation forests. The coniferous species with high intra-specific teleconnections over large distances were, in decreasing importance, Pinus uncinata (>500km), Picea abies (477km), Pinus cembra (over 254 km) and Larix decidua (over 189 km only). The two former species showed the highest intraspecific correlations (with mean correlation R=0.625 and 0.666). The dendrochronological teleconnections were found to have a extent lesser for trees species that depend on rainfall (such as larch, and stone pine). They are enhanced, however, for temperature sensitive species such as spruce and mountain pine (a drought resistant tree). Therefore, these two latter conifers appear to be especially suitable for climatic reconstruction over large distances in mountainous areas. However, teleconnections within silver fir (Abies alba) and spruce chronologies were sharply reduced (over 131 kin and 135 km) in lower elevation forests, underlining the interest of timberline forests for dendroclimatology.A better knowledge of the spatial correlations in climatic series and ring-width data may enable the optimisation of weather station networks. It may also permit a better choice of weather stations used for dendroclimatology, either for tree-ring and climate relationship calibration or for climate reconstructions. In dendrochronology, wood dating also requires the knowledge of to what extent remote ring-width chronologies can be used.\n",

      "Interactions between climate and soil remain ambiguous, particularly when silicate weathering and clay mineral formation and transformation rates are considered in relation to global climate changes. Recent studies suggest that climate affects weathering rates much less than previously thought. Here we show that the climate in the central European Alps has a significant, but indirect, influence on the weathering of soils through vegetation. The pattern of element leaching and mineral transformations is not only due to precipitation and temperature. Element leaching was greatest in Subalpine forests near the timberline: weathering is lessened at higher and lower altitudes. Vegetation, therefore, contributes significantly to weathering processes. The highest accumulation of organic matter was found in climatically cooler sites (subalpine range) where the production of organic ligands, which enhance weathering, is greatest. Patterns of smectite formation and distribution had strong similarities to that of the elemental losses of Fe and Al (R=0.69; P < 0.01) or base cations (R=0.58: P < 0.05). Higher precipitation rates and the production of organic chelating compounds in the soil promoted the appearance of smectites. The relationship between climate, element leaching (Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, K, Na), and smectite formation is strongly nonlinear and driven by the podzolisation process. which is more pronounced near the timberline because of the bioclimatic constellation. Climate warming will probably, in the future, lead to a decrease in SOM stocks in the subalpine to alpine range because of more favourable conditions for biodegradation that would also affect weathering processes.

      "Annual variation in meteorological parameters (7 years) and pollen deposition (6 years) for 4 sites on a transect across an altitudinal timberline on Aakenus, a fell in northern Finland were monitored, in order to see how pollen production, as reflected by pollen deposition (grains cm(-2) year(-1)), is related to climate conditions. Wind direction and wind speed before and after estimated flowering time were determined. These indicated that within the forest and at the physiognomic forest line, pollen deposition is primarily from plants growing within the forested area on the fell and that the contribution of windblown pollen from further south is minimal. Pollen deposition can, therefore, be taken as equivalent to pollen production. Simple linear correlation coefficients between pollen deposition and one-month and two-week mean temperature effective temperature sums and cumulative effective temperature sums for the current and previous summers were calculated.For Pinus sylvestris the quantity of pollen deposited is affected by July mean temperature, July effective temperature sum and total effective temperature sum, for the year previous to pollen emission. Pollen deposition of Betula pubescens and Picea abies is also affected by thermal factors but of different time periods (Betula of early June and Picea of early July), but always of the year previous to flowering. However, the correlation is not as strong as for Pinus. The results suggest that annual fossil Pinus pollen quantities, if calculated from peat and/or lake sediments, are a potential climate proxy. They also demonstrate that it is possible to use temperature parameters of the current year to make forecasts of the intensity of flowering and pollen production in the following year.\n",

      "Five portable Bruker EM27/SUN FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectrometers have been used for the accurate and precise observation of column-averaged abundances of CO2 and CH4 around the major city Berlin. In the work by Frey et al. (2015), a calibration procedure is developed and applied to the set of spectrometers used for the Berlin campaign. Here, we describe the observational setup of the campaign and aspects of the data analysis, and we present the recorded time series of XCH4 and XCO2. We demonstrate that the CO2 emissions of Berlin can be clearly identified in the observations. A simple dispersion model is applied which indicates a total strength of the Berlin source of about 0.8 t CO2 s(-1).

      "Key message: Temperature is a major limiting factor of Pinus koraiensis radial growth, while which exhibited various growth responses at different sites of its distribution area to recent climate warming. Abstract: Six Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) tree-ring chronologies were developed in northeast Asia. Growth trends in recent decades were compared and main factors limiting growth were identified within each site. The spatio-temporal stability of climate–growth relationships were also tested for important climate variables. Results showed that temperature played a key role in controlling Korean pine growth, while recent growth showed strong geographic patterns. Tree growth in recent decades at two south and high altitude sites increased with temperature, remained constant for two low-altitude sites at its central distribution, and decreased for two moderately altitude sites at its distribution north margin. Tree-ring principle of the ecological amplitude was proved again, i.e., trees growing near the margin of its natural range has higher climate sensitivity. Drought stress due to temperature increases appeared to be a primary reason for Korean pine growth decline, whereas varying degrees of drought stress were distinctly dependent on site conditions. Variation of climate-growth relationships over time for different sites was consistent with their recent growth. Two average chronologies for six sites revealed a decreased (Heihe, Mudanjiang, and Liangshui) or inverse (Dunhua, WPS, and Wuying) growth response to rapid warming since 1980, which was possibly related to unique site conditions and various large-scale climate impacts. In addition, our results indicated that modeling possible reactions of forest to global warming or reconstructing past climate need to consider diverse spatio-temporal variations of climate-growth relationships of Korean pine in northeast Asia. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Trees possess myriad adaptations for coping with drought stress, but the extent to which their drought responses are influenced by interactions with soil microbes is poorly understood. To explore the role of microbes in mediating tree responses to drought stress, we exposed saplings of three species (Acer saccharum, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Quercus alba) to a four week experimental drought in mesocosms. Half of the pots were inoculated with a live soil slurry (i.e., a microbial inoculum derived from soils beneath the canopies of mature A. saccharum, L. tulipifera or Q. alba stands), while the other half of the pots received a sterile soil slurry. Soil microbes ameliorated drought stress in L. tulipifera by minimizing reductions in leaf water potential and by reducing photosynthetic declines. In A. saccharum, soil microbes reduced drought stress by lessening declines in leaf water potential, though these changes did not buffer the trees from declining photosynthetic rates. In Q. alba, soil microbes had no effects on leaf physiological parameters during drought stress. In all species, microbes had no significant effects on dynamic C allocation during drought stress, suggesting that microbial effects on plant physiology were unrelated to source–sink dynamics. Collectively, our results suggest that soil microbes have the potential to alter key parameters that are used to diagnose drought sensitivity (i.e., isohydry or anisohydry). To the extent that our results reflect dynamics occurring in forests, a revised perspective on plant hydraulic strategies that considers root-microbe interactions may lead to improved predictions of forest vulnerability to drought. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Currently, 52% of the world's population resides in urban areas and as a consequence, approximately 70% of fossil fuel emissions of CO2 arise from cities. This fact, in combination with large uncertainties associated with quantifying urban emissions due to lack of appropriate measurements, makes it crucial to obtain new measurements useful to identify and quantify urban emissions. This is required, for example, for the assessment of emission mitigation strategies and their effectiveness. Here, we investigate the potential of a satellite mission like Carbon Monitoring Satellite (CarbonSat) which was proposed to the European Space Agency (ESA) to retrieve the city emissions globally, taking into account a realistic description of the expected retrieval errors, the spatiotemporal distribution of CO2 fluxes, and atmospheric transport. To achieve this, we use (i) a high-resolution modelling framework consisting of the Weather Research Forecasting model with a greenhouse gas module (WRF-GHG), which is used to simulate the atmospheric observations of column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fractions (XCO2), and (ii) a Bayesian inversion method to derive anthropogenic CO2 emissions and their errors from the CarbonSat XCO2 observations. We focus our analysis on Berlin, Germany using CarbonSat's cloud-free overpasses for 1 reference year. The dense (wide swath) CarbonSat simulated observations with high spatial resolution (approximately 2 km x 2 km) permits one to map the city CO2 emission plume with a peak enhancement of typically 0.8-1.35 ppm relative to the background. By performing a Bayesian inversion, it is shown that the random error (RE) of the retrieved Berlin CO2 emission for a single overpass is typically less than 8-10 MtCO(2) yr(-1) (about 15-20% of the total city emission). The range of systematic errors (SEs) of the retrieved fluxes due to various sources of error (measurement, modelling, and inventories) is also quantified. Depending on the assumptions made, the SE is less than about 610 MtCO(2) yr(-1) for most cases. We find that in particular systematic modelling-related errors can be quite high during the summer months due to substantial XCO2 variations caused by biogenic CO2 fluxes at and around the target region. When making the extreme worst-case assumption that biospheric XCO2 variations cannot be modelled at all (which is overly pessimistic), the SE of the retrieved emission is found to be larger than 10 MtCO(2) yr(-1) for about half of the sufficiently cloud-free overpasses, and for some of the overpasses we found that SE may even be on the order of magnitude of the anthropogenic emission. This indicates that biogenic XCO2 variations cannot be neglected but must be considered during forward and/or inverse modelling. Overall, we conclude that a satellite mission such as CarbonSat has high potential to obtain city-scale CO2 emissions as needed to enhance our current understanding of anthropogenic carbon fluxes, and that CarbonSat-like satellites should be an important component of a future global carbon emission monitoring system.\n",

      "Purpose: Anthropogenic-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rates derived from the soil are influenced by long-term nitrogen (N) deposition and N fertilization. However, our understanding of the interplay between increased N load and GHG emissions among soil aggregates is incomplete. Materials and methods: Here, we conducted an incubation experiment to explore the effects of soil aggregate size and N addition on GHG emissions. The soil aggregate samples (0–10 cm) were collected from two 6-year N addition experiment sites with different vegetation types (mixed Korean pine forest vs. broad-leaved forest) in Northeast China. Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) production were quantified from the soil samples in the laboratory using gas chromatography with 24-h intervals during the incubation (at 20 °C for 168 h with 80 % field water capacity). Results and discussion: The results showed that the GHG emission/uptake rates were significantly higher in the micro-aggregates than in the macro-aggregates due to the higher concentration of soil bio-chemical properties (DOC, MBC, NO3 −, NH4 +, SOC and TN) in smaller aggregates. For the N addition treatments, the emission/uptake rates of GHG decreased after N addition across aggregate sizes especially in mixed Korean pine forest where CO2 emission was decreased about 30 %. Similar patterns in GHG emission/uptake rates expressed by per soil organic matter basis were observed in response to N addition treatments, indicating that N addition might decrease the decomposability of SOM in mixed Korean pine forest. The global warming potential (GWP) which was mainly contributed by CO2 emission (&gt;98 %) decreased in mixed Korean pine forest after N addition but no changes in broad-leaved forest. Conclusions: These findings suggest that soil aggregate size is an important factor controlling GHG emissions through mediating the content of substrate resources in temperate forest ecosystems. The inhibitory effect of N addition on the GHG emission/uptake rates depends on the forest type. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Abies fabri is a typical subalpine dark coniferous forest in southwestern China. Air temperature increases more at high elevation areas than that at low elevation areas in mountainous regions, and climate change ratio is also uneven in different seasons. Carbon gain and the response of water use efficiency (WUE) to annual and seasonal increases in temperature with or without CO2 fertilization were simulated in Abies fabri using the atmospheric-vegetation interaction model (AVIM2). Four future climate scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were selectively investigated. The results showed that warmer temperatures have negative effects on gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) in growing seasons and positive effects in dormant seasons due to the variation in the leaf area index. Warmer temperatures tend to generate lower canopy WUE and higher ecosystem WUE in Abies fabri. However, warmer temperature together with rising CO2 concentrations significantly increase the GPP and NPP in both growing and dormant seasons and enhance WUE in annual and dormant seasons because of the higher leaf area index (LAI) and soil temperature. The comparison of the simulated results with and without CO2 fertilization shows that CO2 has the potential to partially alleviate the adverse effects of climate warming on carbon gain and WUE in subalpine coniferous forests. © 2017, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Little is known about whether increasing iWUE (intrinsic water use efficiency) can stimulate tree growth in the temperature-limited natural timberlines. Here, we presented the basal area increment (BAI) and iWUE chronologies of Smith fir (Abies georgei var. smithii) from 1900 to 2006 at a high-elevation (ca. 4400 m a.s.l.) timberline in the humid Sygera Mountains, southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). The commonality analysis model was applied to investigate the relationships among BAI, temperatures, atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca) and iWUE during 1961–2006, taking into account of both pure and joint effects. As illustrated by the commonality analysis model, the pure effect of Ca (39.15%) had more stronger influence on iWUE than that of the Tmean (annul mean temperature, 0.12%), but the joint effect between Ca and Tmean (49.79%) on iWUE was stronger than any pure effect for the raw data with an increasing trend. For the first-difference data with year-to-year variations, the pure effect of Ca (7.72%) on iWUE was stronger than that of Tmean (0.59%) and the joint effect between them (0.59%). All above imply the Ca is the dominant factor for iWUE both for the 46-year trend and interannual variations. In addition, as showed by the commonality analysis model, the pure effect of iWUE (17.57%) played a much more important role on BAI than that of temperatures (smt, mean temperature during June, July, August of current year, 5.92%; amt, mean temperature during September, October, November of previous year, 3.04%), while joint effects of iWUE and temperatures contributed more (27.96%; 13.90%; 16.47%) to the BAI than their pure effects for the raw data with an increasing linear trend. For the first-difference data with interannual variations, the pure effect of smt (12.45%) had much more effect on BAI than that of iWUE (5.49%), at the same time the joint iWUE and temperatures contributed less (3.56%; 1.9%; 1.31%) to the BAI than their pure effects. These results suggest that an increasing iWUE could enhance 46-year increasing tree growth trend at humid and high-elevation timberlines, supporting the CO2 fertilization hypothesis, while temperatures dominate the interannual variations of tree growth. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.\n",

      "Seedling density, tree density and basal area of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) were monitored and compared in the timberline areas of northern Finland during the period 1983-99. Rows of 9-12 circular plots were established at 13 localities in four regions: pine-dominated northern and southern regions and spruce-dominated western and eastern regions. Temporal changes were monitored in three altitudinal zones: in the forest, at the coniferous timberline (where forest canopy closure ceases), and at the tree line (where coniferous trees higher than 2 in cease). Pine seedling densities decreased abruptly in the southern region, especially at the timberline, but increased slightly in the northern region. The zone - region - change interaction was significant. The change in spruce seedling densities was small in the forest and timberline zones, but the densities more than doubled at the tree line. Tree density and basal area increased in all the zones and regions. New regeneration and tree establishment during the study period indicate a potential for the tree line to advance. However, there was great heterogeneity in regeneration and seedling establishment among the localities.\n",

      "In order to reduce the uncertainty of offline land surface model (LSM) simulations of land evapotranspiration (ET), we used ensemble simulations based on three meteorological forcing datasets [Princeton, ITPCAS (Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences), Qian] and four LSMs (BATS, VIC, CLM3.0 and CLM3.5), to explore the trends and spatiotemporal characteristics of ET, as well as the spatiotemporal pattern of ET in response to climate factors over mainland China during 1982–2007. The results showed that various simulations of each member and their arithmetic mean (Ens Mean) could capture the spatial distribution and seasonal pattern of ET sufficiently well, where they exhibited more significant spatial and seasonal variation in the ET compared with observation-based ET estimates (Obs MTE). For the mean annual ET, we found that the BATS forced by Princeton forcing overestimated the annual mean ET compared with Obs MTE for most of the basins in China, whereas the VIC forced by Princeton forcing showed underestimations. By contrast, the Ens Mean was closer to Obs MTE, although the results were underestimated over Southeast China. Furthermore, both the Obs MTE and Ens Mean exhibited a significant increasing trend during 1982–98; whereas after 1998, when the last big EI Ni˜no event occurred, the Ens Mean tended to decrease significantly between 1999 and 2007, although the change was not significant for Obs MTE. Changes in air temperature and shortwave radiation played key roles in the long-term variation in ET over the humid area of China, but precipitation mainly controlled the long-term variation in ET in arid and semi-arid areas of China. © 2016, Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Land use and land cover change (LUCC) is one of the important human forcing on climate. However, it is difficult to infer how LUCC will affect climate in the future from the effects of previous LUCC on regional climates in the past. Thus, based on the land cover data recommended by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), a regional climate model (RegCM4) was used to investigate the climate effects of future land use change over China. Two 15-year simulations (2036–2050), one with the current land use data and the other with future land cover scenario (2050) were conducted. It is noted that future LUCC in China is mainly characterized by the transition from the grassland to the forest. Results suggest that the magnitudes and ranges of the changes in temperature and precipitation caused by future LUCC show evident seasonality, which are more prominent in summer and autumn. Significant response of climate to future LUCC mainly happens in Northeast China, North China, the Hetao Area, Eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and South China. Further investigation shows that future LUCC can also produce significant impacts on the atmospheric circulation. LUCC results in abnormal southwesterly wind over extensive areas from the Indian peninsula to the coasts of the South China Sea and South China through the Bay of Bengal. Furthermore, Indian tropical southwest monsoons and South Sea southwest monsoons will both be strong, and the abnormal water vapor convergence from the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean will result in more precipitation in South China. © 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Combining nine tree growth proxies from four sites, from the west coast of Norway to the Kola Peninsula of NW Russia, provides a well replicated (> 100 annual measurements per year) mean index of tree growth over the last 1200 years that represents the growth of much of the northern pine timberline forests of northern Fennoscandia. The simple mean of the nine series, z-scored over their common period, correlates strongly with mean June to August temperature averaged over this region (r = 0.81), allowing reconstructions of summer temperature based on regression and variance scaling. The reconstructions correlate significantly with gridded summer temperatures across the whole of Fennoscandia, extending north across Svalbard and south into Denmark. Uncertainty in the reconstructions is estimated by combining the uncertainty in mean tree growth with the uncertainty in the regression models. Over the last seven centuries the uncertainty is < 4.5% higher than in the 20th century, and reaches a maximum of 12% above recent levels during the 10th century. The results suggest that the 20th century was the warmest of the last 1200 years, but that it was not significantly different from the 11th century. The coldest century was the 17th. The impact of volcanic eruptions is clear, and a delayed recovery from pairs or multiple eruptions suggests the presence of some positive feedback mechanism. There is no clear and consistent link between northern Fennoscandian summer temperatures and solar forcing.\n",

      "Studying the vegetation feedback during warm periods of the past can lead to better understanding of those in the future. In this study, we conducted several simulations to analyze vegetation feedback during the mid-Pliocene warm period. The results indicate that the main features of vegetation change in the mid-Pliocene were a northward shift of needleleaf tree, an expansion of broadleaf tree and shrub, and a northward expansion of grass, as compared to the pre-industrial period. The global annual mean warming ratio caused by vegetation feedback was 12.1%, and this warming ratio was much larger in northern middle and high latitudes. The warming caused by vegetation change was directly related to the surface albedo change and was further amplified by snow/sea ice-albedo feedback. © 2014, Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Complex topography buffers forests against deforestation in mountainous regions. However, it is unknown if terrain also shapes forest distribution in lowlands where human impacts are likely to be less constrained by terrain. In such regions, if important at all, topographic effects will depend on cultural-historical factors and thus be human-driven (anthropogenic) rather than natural, except in regions where the general climate or extreme soils limit the occurrence of forests. We used spatial regression modeling to assess the extent to which topographic factors explain forest distribution (presence-absence at a 48×48 m resolution) in a lowland agricultural region (Denmark, 43,075 km2) at regional and landscape scales (whole study area and 10×10 km grid cells, respectively), how landscape-scale forest-topography relationships vary geographically, and which potential drivers (topographic heterogeneity, forest cover, clay content, coastal/inland location) determine this geographic heterogeneity. Given a moist temperate climate and non-extreme soils all landscapes in Denmark would naturally be largely forest covered, and any topographic relationships will be totally or primarily human-driven. At regional scale, topographic predictors explained only 5% of the distribution of forest. In contrast, the explanatory power of topography varied from 0%-61% at landscape scale, with clear geographic patterning. Explanatory power of topography at landscape scale was moderately dependent on the potential drivers, with topographic control being strongest in areas with high topographic heterogeneity and little forest cover. However, these conditioning effects were themselves geographically variable. Our findings show that topography by shaping human land-use can affect forest distribution even in flat, lowland regions, but especially via localized, geographically variable effects. © 2014 Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "The sensitivity of carbon (C) assimilation to within-canopy nitrogen (N) allocation and of stomatal conductance (g s) to environmental variables were investigated along a vertical canopy gradient in a fertile Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] stand. Maximum rates of ribulose bisphosphate-saturated carboxylation (V cmax) and electron transport (J max) exhibited weak relationships with needle N content. Using these relationships together with a combined stomatal-photosynthesis model, it was found that the sensitivity of C assimilation of 12 1-year old shoots to within-canopy N allocation pattern was very weak. Modelled C assimilation based on optimal compared to observed N allocation pattern increased by only 1-2 %, and altering total needle N content by ±30 % resulted in a 2-4 % change in modelled C assimilation. C assimilation was more sensitive to water use and changed by 8-12 % in response to ±30 % altered stomatal conductance. No indications of significant limitations of photosynthesis by other nutrients or non-optimal within-canopy allocation of water were detected. The sensitivity of g s to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was found to be stronger in the lower canopy, while no significant within-canopy variation was observed in light-saturated g s or stomatal sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit (VPD). The results of this study show that, at this N rich site, photosynthesis integrated for shoots at different canopy positions is only marginally affected by N allocation pattern and that increased stand-scale N availability would only be truly beneficial to canopy photosynthesis if it resulted in increased leaf area. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Annual mean temperature increases will cause alterations in many ecosystem processes, which affect plants given their physiological sensitivity to temperature. That is closely related with plant growing conditions, genotype and plasticity. We studied the photosynthetic responses to instantaneous temperature changes and functional leaf traits in two tropical tree species associated with different successional positions, Zygia longifolia (early successional) and Dipteryx oleifera (late successional), in the northern lowlands of Costa Rica. We found that D. oleifera had thicker leaves and lower stomatal density, but similar specific leaf area to Z. longifolia. Maximum photosynthetic rate (A max) and maximum RuBP saturate rate of carboxylation were higher in Z. longifolia than in D. oleifera. At 37 °C, only Z. longifolia reduced A max and water use efficiency (WUE). But D. panamensis presented more severe effects on the quantum yield, respiration and light compensation points. The temperature response curves showed a similar optimum temperature near 27 °C for both species. On the other hand, the low and high temperature compensation points were different, with D. oleifera showing a narrower range than Z. longifolia. As a whole, we found two different strategies to avoid temperature stress: one reducing WUE (Z. longifolia), and the other one increasing metabolic rates (D. oleifera). However, the ability to withstand stressful situations may, in a larger context, negatively affect ecosystem water and carbon fluxes. Also, functional plasticity in response to temperature changes may relatively affect the ecosystem by causing long-term variations in their representation within the complex diversity mosaic of their forest habitats. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "It is well known that forest ecosystems provide important functions in global and regional climate by strongly influencing the exchanges of energy and moisture between the earth's surface and the adjacent atmosphere (e.g. Taylor and Lebel 1998). The protective cover of the forest canopy influences the physical characteristics of the land surface such as albedo, rainfall interception and surface roughness (e.g. Xue and Shukla 1994). Changes in the physical properties of a forested area such as the removal of forest canopy by natural disturbances such as fire or anthropogenic causes (e.g. Shine and Forster de 1999) will cause changes in the surface albedo thus causing radiative-forcing change affecting the regional radiation balance (IPCC 2001). © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Over the 4.6 billion years of its existence, the Earth has seen a large variety of climate states. During the evolution of our planet, its climate was characterized by periods of enhanced climate variability or even swings and some more or less stable - almost quiet - periods. Natural climate variability was the rule rather than an exception and the evolution of life on Earth was closely linked to climate and its change. For about 250 years, mankind has interfered stronger with the climate system via the release of radiative gases and particles in substantial amounts into the atmosphere. A global mean near surface temperature increase - global warming - can be deduced from instrumental observations, which started in about 1860. The pace and amount of this temperature increase is unprecedented at least the past 1600 years, as reconstructions from proxy data indicate. The observed warming can be attributed to a large extent to human activities as the most recent report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states. The atmospheric temperature increase is accompanied by an increase in sea surface temperature and a rise of the sea level. Evidence is building that human-induced climate change has also a direct influence on changes in precipitation and the hydrological cycle. Climate projection driven by socio-economic scenarios indicate that the global temperature and sea level rise will continue throughout the twenty-first century and beyond, the amount of which is strongly dependent on the underlying emission assumptions. There are a few climate elements that may be sensitive to sudden, abrupt changes, when a set of conditioning parameters is overstepped or certain thresholds are passed; a prominent example is a possible collapse of the thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic. Here, further research in necessary to quantify thres-holds, effects and time horizons. Overall it can be said that a certain amount of future climate change is unavoidable regardless which route of emission reductions mankind will follow and that emissions from the twenty-first century will noticeably affect climate over the entire millennium. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

      "The purpose of the present survey was to describe the effects of forest transformation on humus ecology in north-eastern lowlands of Germany. A chronosequence was developed from four stands: one pure Scots pine experimental plot (K 75 R, 84 years old), two Scots pine stands with a beech understory (K 74 Mi, 34 years old and K 75 Mi, 57 years old) and a beech stand (K 86) with an age of 91 years. Sections were set up at each site along which more than 400 humus bricks were characterized. Additionally, the carbon content in the mineral soil horizon was analyzed down to a depth of 1.6 m. Within the chronosequence the humus layer decreased in thickness and the humus form shifted from mor to mor-like mull and oligomull. Furthermore, a continuous decrease in humus stock and in the vertical distribution of soil organic matter between the storage in the litter layer and the storage in the mineral soil was observed. The phenomena were also found in the pure stands in similar dimensions. In contrast, the stands with the beech understorey show an initial humus accumulation in the litter layer. This phenomenon seems to indicate temporal variation and spatial heterogeneity in humus disintegration in the transformed mixed stands. The causes of the changes in humus form and humus stock are discussed. Scenarios are postulated for vertical soil organic matter distribution when by different tree species are planted during forest transformation. © 2002, Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.\n",

      "Even if humans stop discharging CO2 into the atmosphere, the average global temperature will still increase during this century. A lot of research has been devoted to prevent and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the atmosphere, in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is one of the technologies that might help to limit emissions. In complement, direct CO2 removal from the atmosphere has been proposed after the emissions have occurred. But, the removal of all the excess anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 will not be enough, due to the fact that CO2 outgases from the ocean as its solubility is dependent of its atmospheric partial pressure. Bringing back the Earth average surface temperature to pre-industrial levels would require the removal of all previously emitted CO2. Thus, the atmospheric removal of other greenhouse gases is necessary. This article proposes a combination of disrupting techniques to transform nitrous oxide (N2O), the third most important greenhouse gas (GHG) in terms of current radiative forcing, which is harmful for the ozone layer and possesses quite high global warming potential. Although several scientific publications cite “greenhouse gas removal,” to our knowledge, it is the first time innovative solutions are proposed to effectively remove N2O or other GHGs from the atmosphere other than CO2. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "There is substantial evidence that both temperature and air pollution are predictors of mortality. Thus far, few studies have focused on the potential interactive effects between the thermal environment and different measures of air pollution. Such interactions, however, are biologically plausible, as (extreme) temperature or increased air pollution might make individuals more susceptible to the effects of each respective predictor. This study investigated the interactive effects between equivalent temperature and air pollution (ozone and particulate matter) in Berlin (Germany) and Lisbon (Portugal) using different types of Poisson regression models. The findings suggest that interactive effects exist between air pollutants and equivalent temperature. Bivariate response surface models and generalised additive models (GAMs) including interaction terms showed an increased risk of mortality during periods of elevated equivalent temperatures and air pollution. Cold effects were mostly unaffected by air pollution. The study underscores the importance of air pollution control in mitigating heat effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "A study conducted by the Prognos economic research institute in Basle on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Economics indicates that there will be no dramatic imbalances in the German power economy over the next twenty-five years. Adaptations are likely to be achieved without abrupt changes. Domestic power companies must defend their positions in stagnating markets. According to Prognos, the consumption of primary energy in the Federal Republic in 2020 will stay more or less at the present level. However, the gross domestic product is to be more than 80 percent higher at that time. Major improvements in energy efficiency are expected in all sectors of energy consumption and energy conversion. The authors of the Prognos study call this a ''sobering CO2 balance''. In the period between 1990 and 2005, which is of special political relevance because the German Federal Chancellor, at the spring 1995 Berlin environmental summit conference, promised a decrease of CO2 emissions by 25% for this very period, emissions of this trace gas (corrected for climatic impacts) will be reduced by only 10.55, according to Prognos. Between 1990 and 2020, this reduction is estimated to amount to merely something over 13%. It should be noted in this context the CO2 reduction forecast was achieved more or less already as a consequence of the structural decline in the new German federal states between 1990 and 1992.In a sensitivity analysis, the authors of the Basle study varied a number of basic assumptions of their energy study; albeit only within a conservative range, i.e. without any drastic changes, and computed them in the models of the forecasting system. Accordingly, the consumption of primary energy in 2020 could be 7% lower than shown in the basic case; for the CO2 emissions, an additional reduction rate of 7.4% is found in this way. The reduction of CO2 emissions between 1990 and 2005 amounts to 12.5% in the sensivity calculations (corrected for climatic impacts). One basic shortcoming lies in the inability of the contract study to look more deeply into alternative scenarios of economic policy.One aspect meriting particularly careful study is the role of the perspectives existing for CO2-free nuclear power. The study assumes a politically undisturbed exploitation of this energy resource. However, there are some inconsistencies. The assumption made by the Prognos experts is not consistent that most of the reactors decommissioned for age reasons will be replaced. Either there are chances of political acceptance and economic benefits, in which case the addition of new nuclear power plants will so beyond the mere replacement of decommissioned plants. Or else, these two conditions do not exist. In that constellation, however, no new plants will be added. The problem of economics, in turn, depends on the price assumptions made for the international primary energy markets. If there were imbalanced upward price surges - which is quite plausible as a long-term assumption - CO2-free nuclear power would remain economically attractive and provide the Federal Republic of Germany, with its low energy resources, with a competitive edge in the global competition for industrial locations.\n",

      "Altitudinal timberlines are thought to move upward by global warming, a crucial topic in ecology. Tall tree species (the conifer Abies mariesii and the deciduous broad-leaved Betula ermanii) dominate the sub-alpine zone between 1600 and 2500 m a.s.l., the timberline, on Mount Norikura in central Japan. Dwarf pine Pinus pumila dominates above the timberline to near the summit (3026 m a.s.l.). This study evaluated how the timberline formed on Mount Norikura by examining altitudinal changes in stand structure and dynamics around the timberline.One hundred and twenty-five plots of 10 m 10 m were established around the timberline (23502600 m a.s.l.). Trunk diameter growth rate during 6 years was examined for A. mariesii, B. ermanii and P. pumila. Mortality during this period and mechanical damage scars on the trunks and branches due to strong wind and snow were examined for A. mariesii only.The density, maximum trunk height and diameter of A. mariesii in plots decreased with altitude. The maximum trunk height of B. ermanii decreased with altitude, but density and maximum trunk diameter did not decrease. In contrast, the density of P. pumila abruptly increased from around the timberline. A strong negative correlation was found between the densities of P. pumila and tall tree species, indicating their interspecific competition. Trunk diameter growth rates of A. mariesii and B. ermanii did not decrease with altitude, suggesting that these two tall tree species can grow at the timberline. The ratio of trees with mechanical damage scars increased with altitude for A. mariesii, a tendency more conspicuous for larger trees. The mortality of larger A. mariesii was also greater at higher altitude. Tall tree species may not increase their trunk height and survive around the timberline because of mechanical damage.This study suggests that the altitudinal location of the timberline is mainly affected by mechanical damage due to strong wind and snow rather than by growth limitation due to low temperature. Therefore, the timberline would not move upward even under global warming if these growth and mortality characteristics do not change for a long time.\n",

      "Current climatic conditions and the occurrence of discontinuous and sporadic permafrost in the Alps result in a low turnover rate and therefore accumulation of organic matter (OM) in soils. Alpine soils are thus highly sensitive to global warming that potentially promotes the mineralisation of soil organic matter (SOM). This process might increase the release of CO2 to the atmosphere. Our aim was to investigate the potential effect of permafrost thawing by the analysis of the physical-chemical soil properties of permafrost versus non-permafrost sites. Specifically, we i) quantified the SOM stocks at such sites, ii) characterised SOM and its physical and chemical fractions and iii) estimated the age range of the bulk soil and stable C-fraction (radiocarbon dating). In south-eastern Switzerland, two areas above the timberline and one below the timberline (where isolated permafrost was verified) were investigated in detail. At each site, the experimental set-up consisted in the comparison of nearby soils that were either influenced or not by permafrost. The C-stocks (down to the C horizon or rock surface) did not show a significant difference between permafrost and non-permafrost soils and were in the same range of 10-15 kg/m(2) in alpine (grassland) and subalpine (forest) sites. Above the timberline, the bulk SOM showed a distinct higher age at permafrost sites compared to non-permafrost sites. This higher age was even more evident in the stable C-fraction (resistant to an H2O2 treatment), where ages of up to 11 ky in permafrost soils were recorded. The highest age obtained in the stable C-fraction in non-permafrost soils was around 4 ky. Consequently, climatic conditions and the occurrence of discontinuous permafrost resulted in a very low turnover rate of SOM. At the subalpine site, the difference between permafrost and non-permafrost sites was less. At both sites (alpine and subalpine), DRIFT (Diffuse Reflection Infrared Fourier Transform) was used to determine the functional groups in the bulk soil and in the stable C-fraction. In general, the stable C-fraction had a different composition compared to the bulk SOM at non-permafrost sites; this was mostly not the case at the permafrost sites. This confirms that different decomposition processes occur between permafrost and non-permafrost sites. Furthermore, permafrost sites accumulated more the low-density physical fractions of SOM that are potentially easily degradable.The obtained results suggest that a warmer climate may not necessarily lead to an increased CO2 release from SOM-degradation in permafrost soils compared to non-permafrost soils. High-alpine soils and OM furthermore integrate a multi-facetted response to the past and ongoing surrounding conditions. The melting of permafrost will most likely enhance vegetation growth, which to a certain degree will probably compensate for carbon losses on the long-term.(c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

      "Research into palaeoecological events from the late Quaternary onwards up to the last deglaciation has progressed significantly in Europe in the last decades. Multidisciplinary stratigraphical studies of lake and mire deposits, using a variety of dating techniques (AMS C-14-dating, ratio of O-18/O-16), carried out a synthesis of the natural and anthropogenic vegetation development dealing with both biotic and physical environmental changes. Compiled regional syntheses are based on approximately nearly 100 key sites, covering around all biogeographical important areas of central and southern Europe.On the background of the European pollen database (EPD) now it is possible to understand patterns of the past, such as tree migrations, timberline-changes, species competition, palaeofloristic changes, etc. In the present paper the main results related to vegetation events and climatic changes in relation to long-term vegetation dynamics are described. The basic data generated by pollen analysts in Europe provide a tool for our understanding of past environmental history such as forest response to Pleistocene climatic change, evolution of new species as well as the establishment of natural deciduous forestry and especially of beech forests in Europe.\n",

      "The upper distribution limit of tall tree species Abies mariesii is the timberline in central Japan, and dwarf pine Pinus pumila dominates above the timberline to near the summit. My previous studies suggested that the main cause of the timberline formation is the increase in mortality due to strong wind in winter rather than low growth due to low summer temperature. This study evaluated how wind velocity affects timberline formation and if the altitude of timberline moves upward due to high thermal conditions, by using a lattice model. Increase in wind velocity throughout the altitude lowered the altitudes of upper distribution limits of the two species. On the contrary, prolonged growth period due to high thermal conditions increased the upper distribution limit of P. pumila, and the upper distribution limit of A. mariesii was hardly affected by the change of growth period. However, the upward shift of the upper distribution limit of P. pumila due to the prolonged growth period in the model would not be realistic because P. pumila had already distributed up to near the summit. This study concludes that A. mariesii is a superior competitor to P. pumila at low altitudes with low wind velocity, but dwarf pine P. pumila can dominate at higher altitudes because A. mariesii suffers severe mechanical damage due to strong wind in winter, and that the altitude of the timberline does not move upward even under high thermal conditions due to global warming.\n",

      "Changes to global climate patterns have the potential to alter the structure of soil microbial communities which are key components of terrestrial ecosystems. High altitude ecosystems are both temperature and Nitrogen-limited and the biota therein is sensitive to these conditions. Temperatures and nitrogen (N) depositions in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are predicted to sharp rise by the end of this century. This study aimed to better understand the effects of warming and N addition treatments alone and in combination on an alpine meadow ecosystem near the timberline zone in the eastern region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The field experiment included replicated plots with an ambient treatment alone or with low N (5 g N m(-2) a(-1)), intermediate N (15 g N m(-2) a(-1)), and high N (30 g N m(-2) a(-1)) (Control, LN, MN, HN) and open top chambers warming treatment alone, or LN and HN additions (W, WLN, WHN) to study the interactive effects of the warming and N additions on the soil microbial community as determined by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Microbial communities and their allied soil and plant properties were examined after 3 years of the treatments. The strength of the relationship between the treatments and their direct and indirect effects on the microbial communities, soil and plant properties were determined using a structural equation model (SEqM). The results indicated that N addition significantly changed surface soil microbial communities, in particular, decreased the fungi: bacteria ratio (F: B) (p < 0.01). The warming differentially influenced some specific microbial biomarkers, such as fungal PLFAs which decreased, and actinobacterial PLFAs, which increased, under warming (p < 0.05). The combination of the warming and N addition showed significantly positive interactive effects (p < 0.001) on soil microorganisms (i.e. the biomass of general bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and etc.) in these alpine soils. The SEqM results show the direct effects of the warming treatment on soil microorganisms were less than those from the N additions. Moreover, warming and N addition had stronger indirect, than direct, effects on the soil microbial community via induced changes in soil properties and plant community. The total effect of warming on the soil microbial community was stronger than that of the N additions. The results suggested interactive effects of the warming and N addition on soil microorganisms in an near timberline alpine ecosystem in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "At a subalpine site with permafrost below the timberline in the eastern Swiss Alps the complex interrelationship between different environmental factors was investigated by applying an integrated approach that combines soil mapping, 3D near-surface geophysics and surface and subsurface temperature monitoring. The objectives of this approach were to explore the 3D extension of isolated permafrost bodies and to relate this to surface parameters such as soils and humus forms and other extrinsic factors. Using this procedure, interdependencies between surface (soil properties and humus forms) and subsurface factors (ground thermal regime and frozen ground conditions) could be independently analysed. Although time-consuming, 3D ER! (electrical resistivity imaging) demonstrated its ability for precise permafrost mapping. Despite climate warming, super-cooling in winter along the investigated scree slopes is still efficient enough for establishing permafrost conditions. By comparing the spatial dimensions of the permafrost bodies with surface conditions, we found that thick moss or organic litter layers had an insulating effect and prevented the permafrost from melting. However, the comparison of soil units and soil thickness with the permafrost distribution did not always show an obvious relationship. This indicates that there is a complex evolution and behaviour of soils and permafrost at such sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Birch (Betula) trees and forests are found across much of the temperate and boreal zones of the Northern Hemisphere. Yet, despite being an ecologically significant genus, it is not well studied compared to other genera like Pinus, Picea, Larix, Juniperus, Quercus, or Fagus. In the Himalayas, Himalayan birch (Betula utilis) is a widespread broadleaf timberline species that survives in mountain rain shadows via access to water from snowmelt. Because precipitation in the Nepalese Himalayas decreases with increasing elevation, we hypothesized that the growth of birch at the upper timberlines between 3900 and 4150 m above sea level is primarily limited by moisture availability rather than by low temperature. To examine this assumption, a total of 292 increment cores from 211 birch trees at nine timberline sites were taken for dendroecological analysis. The synchronous occurrence of narrow rings and the high interseries correlations within and among sites evidenced a reliable cross-dating and a common climatic signal in the tree-ring width variations. From March to May, all nine tree-ring-width site chronologies showed a strong positive response to total precipitation and a less-strong negative response to temperature. During the instrumental meteorological record (from 1960 to the present), years with a high percentage of locally missing rings coincided with dry and warm pre-monsoon seasons. Moreover, periods of below-average growth are in phase with well-known drought events all over monsoon Asia, showing additional evidence that Himalayan birch growth at the upper timberlines is persistently limited by moisture availability. Our study describes the rare case of a drought-induced alpine timberline that is comprised of a broadleaf tree species.\n",

      "Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are characterized by high fuel efficiency and are therefore usually the thermal power producing units of choice within a district heating network. The operation of CHP units is typically controlled by the current heat demand and thus delimits the range of electricity production. Heat storage devices are a promising alternative to uncouple the heat load of the district heating network from the commitment of the units and to allow for price-oriented electricity production.In this paper we present numerical results for the combined optimization of the operation of nineteen existing power plant units and the design of six proposed heat accumulators which supply the district heating network of Berlin. A mixed-integer programming problem (MIP) is formulated in GAMS and solved with CPLEX. This paper focuses on the potential for increasing profitability through the addition of heat accumulators in the energy system described above, on the optimal storage capacities for different price scenarios (variation of fuel costs, prices for carbon dioxide emission certificates, and electricity price time series) as well as on the adjustment of the operation of the power plants due to heat storage.

      "Landslide-prone areas in flysch sequences are widespread in Switzerland, covering approximately 1000 km(2). Mass movements can be caused by ground conditions inherited from geological or glacial history, by preparing causal factors linked to climate or human activities and by triggering causal factors related to weather, public works or earthquakes. We identified three periods of major crisis in unstable zones of flysch terranes during the past ten thousand years (Holocene): using dendrochronological analysis and C-14 dating on fossil wood collected in landslides. We correlated these periods to other data (glacier fluctuation and timberline) and we underscore a strong relationship between climate change and landslide activity. Taking into account the latest predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 1996), the spatial distribution of landslides in flysch terranes will not change in the future but the unstable zones located between 1000 m and 1500 m will probably suffer from a marked increase in the rate of movements in landslides already active.\n",

Needle litter and fine root density also decreased. The spatially averaged annual Soil CO2 efflux was 35 g C m(-2) year(-1) in 2002. About 70% of the temporal variation in soil respiration could be explained by variations in soil temperature, whereas the influence of soil water potential and thus soil water content was negligible because soil water availability was supra-optimal.\n",

      "Little is known about the intensity and extension of subsurface urban heat islands (UHI), and the individual role of the driving factors has not been revealed either. In this study, we compare groundwater temperatures in shallow aquifers beneath six German cities of different size (Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Karlsruhe and Darmstadt). It is revealed that hotspots of up to +20 K often exist, which stem from very local heat sources, such as insufficiently insulated power plants, landfills or open geothermal systems. When visualizing the regional conditions in isotherm maps, mostly a concentric picture is found with the highest temperatures in the city centers. This reflects the long-term accumulation of thermal energy over several centuries and the interplay of various factors, particularly in heat loss from basements, elevated ground surface temperatures (GST) and subsurface infrastructure. As a primary indicator to quantify and compare large-scale UHI intensity the 10-90%-quantile range UHIl(10-90) of the temperature distribution is introduced. The latter reveals, in comparison to annual atmospheric UHI intensities, an even more pronounced heating of the shallow subsurface. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "(10)Be dating of prominent glacier advances (stadials) in the Alps supports the correlation of the Gschnitz stadial (> 15.4 ka) with the Heinrich 1 ice rafting event (Greenland Stadial 2a), the Egesen-maximum advance (similar to 12.3-12.4 ka) with the early Younger Dryas (Greenland Stadial 1), the Kartell advance (similar to 10.8 ka) with the Preboreal Oscillation and the Kromer advance (similar to 8.4 ka) with the Central European cold phase 3. The interpretation of the glacial record with glacier-climate models in terms of summer temperature change (Delta Ts) and precipitation change (Delta P) shows that climate during the Gschnitz stadial was similar to 10 K colder than at present and precipitation was reduced to similar to 25% of modern annual sums with a possible tendency towards slightly more humid conditions in the southeastern Alps. During the early Younger Dryas, Delta P depends on the estimated Delta Ts. For a Delta Ts of -3.5 K, Delta P along the northern fringe of the Eastern Alps was about 0 to + 15%, in the central valleys Delta P was in the order of -20 to -30%. A scenario with a Delta Ts of -5 K leads to generally drier conditions ( similar to-15% vs. similar to-50% Delta P) but the spatial pattern of precipitation change remains the same. The Kromer advance was possibly characterised by more humid conditions than today along the northern fringe of the Eastern Alps. In the valleys of the Central Alps, precipitation seems to have been similar to modern values. Methodologically, simple empirical relationships between summer temperature and precipitation at the equilibrium line altitude yield similar results as an analytical glacial-meteorological model. However, the analytical model allows a more detailed analysis of the climatic parameters influencing glacier behaviour. In the case of the Egesen-maximum and Kromer advances, the accuracy of Delta P depends on the reliability of Delta Ts, which is derived from timberline depression and on the dating control. In the case of the Gschnitz stadial, the accuracy of Delta Ts depends mainly on the glacier flow model, from which Delta P is derived. Since the model reacts sensitively to assumptions about basal sliding, only scenarios can be calculated. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The first 1,000 year long Carpathian tree-ring width chronology was established based on living and subfossil stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) samples from an upper timberline forest located in Calimani Mts. (Romania). Tree-ring data were standardized using the regional curve standardization method in order to preserve the low and medium frequency climate signals. The de-trended index strongly correlates with summer mean temperature both at annual and decadal scales. The Calimani summer mean temperature anomalies were reconstructed for the period ad 1163-2005 applying the rescaling method. This new climate proxy from the Carpathians shows similar fluctuations to other North Hemispheric temperature reconstructions, but with periods of distinct differences. The fingerprint of Little Ice Age in the Calimani area is visible between ad 1370 and 1630 followed by lagged cold decades in ad 1820 and 1840. The recent warming is evident only after the 1980s in our reconstruction.\n",

      "The results of a study of littoral chironomid communities from 89 lakes in the Alps are presented. The lakes are located on the northern and southern sides of the Alps from the western Bernese to the eastern Julian Alps. Due to the different origins of the data set here considered, different sampling years and sampling methodologies were adopted. All of the lakes were sampled during the ice-free season, but 79/89 lakes were sampled mainly in autumn 2000, while for a few of them the sample dated back to 1996 or the early 90s. Samples were taken by kicking the different substrata or a stretch of lakeshore (10-30 m) for at least 2-5 min with a standard net and were then preserved in alcohol. Larvae and pupal exuviae were sampled by skimming the lake surface with the same net, to extend identification to species level. Notwithstanding the large altitudinal gradient, almost all of the lakes are situated above the timberline, and show a wide range of morphological (depth, watershed and lake area) and chemical characteristics. Chironomids were the most abundant insects represented in these lakes, with highest abundances at pH between 6.0 and 7.5. In particular, Orthocladiinae and Chironominae were the two subfamilies with the widest distribution. Altitude and temperature played an important role in determining their distribution, the higher altitudes were dominated by the former, whereas the latter were more numerous in lower lakes. The prevalence of Orthocladiinae and Tanytarsini at high altitudes was regarded as a general pattern of taxonomic composition in harsh climatic areas. A reverse condition occurred only in the Julian Alps, where Tanytarsini dominate, followed by Tanypodinae and rare Orthocladiinae. Although our results demonstrated that the composition of chironomid assemblages was also determined by pH, the pattern was unbalanced. Due to the fact that no cases of strong water acidification were present, taxa restricted to very low pH were poorly represented (only three taxa-Limnophyes, Endochironomus and Orthocladius (O.) spp.) compared with circumneutral (8) and alkaline (14) taxa, which occurred in slightly acid and non-acidified soft water lakes. As regard conductivity and altitude, we found that almost all the taxa present at higher pH were contemporary present at conductivity higher than 100 mu eq l(-1) and altitude lower than 2100 m a.s.l. At species level, Pseudodiamesa branickii, Corynoneura arctica, Heterotrissocladius marcidus and Paratanytarsus austriacus resulted to be the most ubiquitous and abundant species in the Alps. When the west to east distribution of taxa was taken into account, Chironomini (particularly the genera Chironomus and Dicrotendipes) and Tanypodinae (Larsia and Paramerina) were more typical of the eastern lakes (JA). They may be better indicators of more alkaline waters. Assembling all the existing data and presenting a comprehensive panorama of lake-littoral chironomid taxa of the Alps was one of the aims of this paper. Further monitoring, but also harmonization of the sampling methodologies and taxonomical identification including inter-calibration exercises among laboratories are recommended, to provide reliable basis and more knowledge for future studies of comparative biogeography, and to preserve these environments where global climatic changes may cause abrupt shifts in the faunal assemblages with a loss of taxa typical of these mountainous areas.\n",

      "Two millennia-length juniper ring width chronologies, processed to preserve multi-centennial growth trends, are presented for the Alai Range of the western Tien Shan in Kirghizia. The chronologies average the information from seven near-timberline sampling sites, and likely reflect summer temperature variation. For comparison, chronologies are also built using standard dendrochronological techniques. We briefly discuss some qualities of these \"inter-decadal\" records, and show the low frequency components removed by the standardization process include a long-term negative trend in the first half of the last millennium and a long-term positive trend since about AD 1800. The multi-centennial scale Alai Range chronologies, where these trends are retained, are both systematically biased (but in an opposite sense) in their low frequency domains. Nevertheless, they represent the best constraints and estimates of long-term summer temperature variation, and reflect the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age, and a period of warming since about the middle of the nineteenth century.\n",

      "The local and regional history of vegetation and climate, from the Late Glacial to the present, is represented in a new, high-resolution pollen diagram from Pian di Gembro (1350 m asl), ten C-14 dates providing a reliable time control. An open pioneer vegetation dominated by Artemisia, Gramineae, and Chenopodiaceae followed the retreat of the glaciers after the Last Glacial Maximum. Shrub vegetation with Juniperus, Alnus viridis, and Salix expanded soon after. Denser Betula-Pinus forests were present in Pian di Gembro around 12,320 B.P. Their extent was greatly reduced by the climatic cooling of the Younger Dryas, when open vegetation spread again. The beginning of the Holocene was marked by a considerable expansion in mixed oak taxa. Corylus immigrated to the site at 9,250 B.P. Picea and Abies expanded at 7,370 B.P., recording an abrupt change in the structure of the vegetational belts. A coeval climatic change is evidenced in the GRIP records and also detectable through oscillations of the timberline. Signs of human impact are present since late Atlantic, becoming more intense around 2,200 B.P. As pasture lands increased, Abies and Fagus slowly disappeared. The introduction of Castanea and Juglans is dated to Roman times, and Secale to the Middle Ages.\n",

      "Recent hypotheses of timberline causation include the possibility that limitations to growth processes may be more limiting than restrictions on photosynthetic carbon gain, and that cold soil is a primary limiting factor at high altitude. However, almost all of the supporting data for timberline causation have come from studies on older trees, with little focus on the mechanisms of seedling establishment and the growth of saplings away from the forest edge into the treeline ecotone. We describe a conceptual model of timberline migration that invokes a strong dependence on ecological facilitation, beginning with seed germination and continuing through seedling establishment and sapling growth to the stage where trees with forest-like stature form new subalpine forest at a higher altitude. In addition to protection from severe mechanical damage, facilitation of photosynthetic carbon gain and carbon processing is enhanced by plasticity in plant form and microsite preference, enabling seedling survival and sapling growth inside and through the often severe boundary layer just above the ground cover. Several forms of facilitation (inanimate, interspecific, intraspecific and structural) result in substantial increases in photosynthetic carbon gain throughout the summer growth period, leading to enhanced root growth, subsequent amelioration of drought stress, and increased seedling survival. Avoidance of low temperatures and low-temperature photoinhibition of photosynthesis may be major benefits of the facilitation, enhancing photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory-driven growth processes. We propose that the growth of vertical stems (flagged tree forms) from krummholz mats is analogous functionally to the facilitated growth of a seedling/sapling in and away from ground cover. Increasing abundance and growth of newly established trees in the treeline ecotone generates a structural and microsite facilitation characteristic of the subalpine forest below. This is followed by the formation of new subalpine forest with forest-like trees, and a new timberline at higher altitude.\n",
      "Multi-proxy palaeoecological and palaeolimnological studies of the sedimentary record of Sagistalsee, a small lake at the present-day timberline in the Swiss Alps, reveal distinct changes in its catchment vegetation in relation to Holocene climate change and human impact. Four phases of catchment vegetation type were defined based on plant macrofossil analyses: open Betula-Pinus cembra woodland, Abies alba-Pinus cembra woodland, Picea abies forest, and cultural pasture. The expansion of spruce similar to 6300 cal. BP had a major impact on all abiotic proxies, whereas the reaction of the biotic proxies to this catchment change was lagged by several centuries. During the Bronze Age (ca. 4000 cal. BP) the spruce forest was cleared and the catchment began to be used as grazing pastures. Changes in sedimentology, geochemistry, and magnetic parameters closely reflect the changes in catchment vegetation. The catchment vegetation types explain a statistically significant amount of the variance in the chironomid, cladoceran, sedimentological, and magnetic data but not in the geochemical data. The strong catchment-lake interaction masks any biotic responses to millennium-scale climatic oscillations.\n",

During the coldest months of the year, December to March, gas exchange was almost completely suppressed and even the highest irradiances and temperatures did not cause a significant increase in net photosynthesis compared to spring and fall. In general, daily CO2 balance was negative between December and March except during extended warm periods in late winter. However, because twig respiration was also reduced to a minimum during the December-March period, daily carbon losses were minimal.

      "\"Greenhouse Effect\", which is scientifically proven to be main caused by the increasing concentration of CO2, has become a topic of national and international concern. Mineral carbonation, such as carbonation of alkaline silicate Ca/Mg minerals, analogous to natural weathering processes, is a potentially attractive route to mitigate possible global warming on the basis of industrial imitation of natural weathering processes.In this paper, three typical natural mineral candidates in China, serpentine, olivine and wollastonite, were selected as carbonation raw materials for direct mineral carbonation experiments under middle and low-pressure. A series number of experiments were carried out to investigate the factors that influence the conversion of carbonation reaction, such as reaction temperature, reaction pressure, particle size, solution composition and pretreatment. The solid products from carbonation experiments were filtered, collected, dried and analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (FSEM-EDX) to identify the reaction of mineral carbonation. And the method of mass equilibrium after heat decomposition was used to calculate the mineral carbonation conversion. All the XRD and FSEM analysis validate that carbonation reaction was occurred during the experiments and mineral carbonation is one of the potential techniques for carbon dioxide sequestration. The data of mass equilibrium after heat decomposition was collected and then the conversion formula was used to calculate the carbonation conversion of all the three mineral candidates. The mass equilibrium results show that, for all of the three mineral materials, the carbonation conversion increases with the increasing of reaction temperature. But once the temperature increases above 150°C, the conversion of serpentine decreases a little. Reaction pressure is also an important factor to mineral carbonation process. For all of the three mineral materials, the carbonation conversion increases with the increasing of reaction pressure. Decrease of mineral particle sizes and use of heat treatment before carbonation experiments can effectively improve the carbonation conversion of mineral carbonation. And the addition of NaHCO3, which had a buffering effect that kept the solution pH in a certain range, can also improve the carbonation conversion. In this paper, a highest carbonation conversion of 89.5% was obtained under the condition of T=150°C, PCO2=4.0MPa, particle sizes &lt;37μm in 1h using wollastonite as the raw material. Compared with serpentine and olivine, wollastonite is the most promising material for carbon dioxide mineral carbonation under middle and low-pressure. © Tsinghua University Press, Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.\n",

CWD accumulated over 40–100 years and yielded C stocks of 11 Mg C ha−1 in the unmanaged spruce forest and 23 and 30 Mg C ha−1 in the two unmanaged beech–oak forests. C stocks of the organic layer were smaller in the beech–oak forests (8 and 19 Mg C ha−1) and greater in the spruce forest (36 Mg C ha−1) than the C stock of CWD. Elevated aboveground CWD stocks did not coincide with greater C stocks in the organic layers and the mineral soils of the unmanaged forests. However, radiocarbon signatures of the Oe and Oa horizons differed among unmanaged and managed beech–oak forests. We attributed these differences to partly faster turnover of organic C, stimulated by greater CWD input in the unmanaged forest. Alternatively, the slower turnover of organic C in the managed forests resulted from lower litter quality following thinning or different tree species composition. Radiocarbon signatures of water-extractable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the top mineral soils point to CWD as potent DOC source. Our results suggest that 40–100 years of forest protection is too short to generate significant changes in C stocks and radiocarbon signatures of forest soils at the stand level. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Eight synchronous pre-Roman cold phases were found at 9600-9200, 8600-8150, 7550-6900, 6600-6200, 5350-4900, 4600-4400, 3500-3200 and 2600-2350 radiocarbon years BP by reconstructing past climate at two sites on the Swiss Plateau and at timberline in the Alps. The cooling events during the early-and mid-Holocene represent temperature values similar to today, and apparently the onset of cooling events represents a deviation from today's mean annual temperature of about 1 degrees C and is triggered at a 1000-year periodicity. At Wallisellen-Langachermoos (440 m), a former oligotrophic lake near Zurich, the correlation between summertime lake levels and the seed production of the amphi-Atlantic aquatic plant Najas flexilis was used to reconstruct lake levels over a 3000-year period during the first part of the Holocene. At Lake Seedorf on the western Swiss Plateau (609 m) the sedimentological, palynological and macrofossil record revealed fluctuations of lake levels for the complete Holocene. From Lago Basso in the southern Alps (2250 m, Val San Giacomo near Splugen Pass, Northern Italy) the terrestrial plant macrofossils - especially Pinus cembra and Larix - allowed the reconstruction of timberline fluctuations controlled by climate. A similar climatic pattern was found at Gouille Rion pond in the central Swiss Alps (2343 m, Val d'Heremence) with plant macrofossils and pollen concentrations and percentages. We postulate that these climatic events are detectable throughout central Europe by independent methods in combination with precise AMS-radiocarbon datings on terrestrial plant remains. Our data fit other proxy records of regional climatic change, such as cool intervals from Greenland ice cores, glacier movements in the Swiss and Austrian Alps, and dendro-densitometry on subfossil wood, as well as the palaeoclimatic data from the Jura Mountains of France obtained by sedimentological analyses. Thus our data indicate that the Northern Hemisphere climate was less stable during the Holocene than previously believed.\n",

      "Because humans spend most of their time indoors and can he negatively affected by unfavourable thermal environments, the assessment of indoor heat stress is an important issue for public health care, To characterise indoor human bioclimate ate, the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was used, UTCI values were calculated from measurements of air temperature and air humidity in 16 rooms in Berlin during the summer months of 2011 and 2012, A constant air velocity of approximately 0,3 m/s and a metabolic heat production of 135 W/m(2) were assumed, The mean radiant temperature was set to the air temperature. Because the mean air humidity was below or slightly above 50 %, the calculated UM values were mostly lower than the air temperatures. In summer 2012, the mean UTCI values ranged from 22,2 degrees C to 27,1 degrees C, and the maximum (ITC' values ranged from 24,7 degrees C to 35,6 degrees C, Whereas only minor differences were found between rooms located within comparable buildings in different districts of Berlin, pronounced variations of the UTC1 values were detected in two adjoining buildings, with differences up to 8,6 K for the daily minimum, 9,8 K for the daily mean and 12,2 K for the daily maximum UTCI between different rooms, These variations can be explained by differences in the structures of the two buildings, floor level and aspect, The UTCI values were also used to determine the occurrence of moderate and strong heat stress, Only two rooms showed no thermal stress, while strong heat stress was detected in three rooms,\n",

      "Environmental abiotic and biotic factors are important in controlling soil CO2 efflux in forest ecosystems of different ages, as they play an important role in soil respiration. In understanding the spatial and temporal variation of soil CO2 efflux after several years of forest logging, there is a need to quantify the changing soil properties, environmental factors, and the total above and below ground biomass. This study was conducted in a 50-year old recovering tropical lowland forest in Peninsular Malaysia, measuring soil CO2 efflux using the continuous open flow chambers technique connected to a multi gas-handling unit and infrared gas analyser. The aim of this study was to determine the spatial and temporal variation of soil CO2 efflux in relation to changes in soil properties, environmental factors and forest carbon in a recovering forest. The efflux rates of about 389.20, 634.78, 564.81, 537.92 and 428.72 mg m−2 h−1, respectively, varied across the days and months, increasing from February and attaining the maximum in March and then gradually decreasing from April to June. The soil properties revealed a considerable amount of soil organic carbon, total organic carbon, and soil organic carbon stock, while the total above ground biomass, below ground biomass, soil pH, nitrogen to carbon ratio were found to provide nutrients for microbial activities in soil and to emit soil CO2. The multiple linear regression model indicated that the soil temperature and moisture explained the spatial and temporal variation in soil CO2 efflux; likewise, the changes in the soil properties and forest carbon significantly increased the soil CO2 efflux indicating a strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.93). © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Forest soils store large stocks of soil organic matter (SOM) and are of vital importance for the ecosystem supply with nutrients and water. According to the available literature, depending on management regime and site properties, different negative and positive effects of forest management (particularly of forest thinnings and shelterwood cuttings) on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) stocks are observed. To elucidate the long-term impact of different shelterwood systems and small clear-cuttings on the OC and N stocks of shallow calcareous soils in the Bavarian Alps, we conducted soil humus inventories on different plots of a mixed mountain forest management experiment started in 1976. The silvicultural multi-treatment experiment consists of a NW-exposed Main Experiment (ME) site with eight plots of different cutting intensity (two unthinned controls, two light shelterwood cuttings = 30 % of basal tree area removed, two heavy shelterwood cuttings = 50 % removed, and two clear-cuttings = 100 % removed) on Triassic dolostone. Additionally, plots were installed at a N-exposed dolostone (ND) site and two sites (FL, FH) on Flysch sandstone (each with one unthinned control and one heavy shelterwood cutting). The shelterwood cuttings from 1976 were repeated in 2003 to re-establish the overstorey basal area as produced by the first cutting in the different plots. Thirty-five years after the first treatments, forest floor SOC and N stocks were significantly decreased (up to −70 %) at the different shelterwood and clear-cut treatments compared to the unthinned control at the ME site despite vigorous development of natural rejuvenation. Also significantly smaller topsoil (forest floor plus mineral soil 0–10 cm depth) OC stocks (between −16 and −20 %) were detected at the thinned compared to the control plots. Differences in topsoil N stocks were also considerable (between −3 and −14 %), but substantially smaller than OC stock changes. For the total soil down to 30 cm depth, OC stocks in the differently thinned plots were consistently smaller compared to the unthinned control plots. Comparable to our findings at the ME site, heavy shelterwood plots at the three other sites (ND, FL, and FH) showed significant losses of OC in the forest floor (up to 43 %), mineral soil (up to 38 %), topsoil (up to 38 %), and total soil (up to 34 %). Significant large absolute and relative SOC decreases coincided with sites characterized by large initial humus stocks. Moreover, significant effects of heavy shelterwood cuttings on SOC and N stocks (on average 23 % SOC loss and 13 % soil N loss for the forest floor plus the uppermost 10 cm mineral soil) were detected on a regional level. Our results show that different shelterwood systems are accompanied with a considerable long-term decrease in OC and N stocks in shallow calcareous forest soils of the Bavarian Alps. However, a comparison with a windthrown forest stand at a nearby similar site indicates that SOM losses after thinning operations are small compared to decreases following windthrow or other calamities with subsequent large soil erosion and increased mineralization processes. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Forest plantations significantly impact soil properties and hydrological processes. Field investigation was carried out to provide insight into the impacts of three forest types (Cunninghamia lanceolata,Pinus elliottii, and mixed forest of Schima superba and Cyclobalanopsis jenseniana) on soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by runoff. SOC and TN contents were measured in soils (0–50 cm) under three forest types on both uphill and downhill. Runoff samples were collected and DOC concentrations were analyzed after 27 erosive rainfalls during the period of April 2011 to April 2012. Results showed that the lowest contents of SOC and TN in top soil layer (0–10 cm) were observed in pure C. lanceolata stands. Vertical distributions of SOC and TN in pure C. lanceolata and pure P. elliottii followed negative power functions on downhill (P < 0.005), while those in mixed S. superba and C. jenseniana followed negative exponential functions on downhill (P < 0.005). DOC concentrations showed no significant correlation with runoff, and the average values were following the order of mixed S. superba andC. jenseniana > C. lanceolata > P. elliottii in 27 erosion rainfall events. The runoff and DOC loss density (DOC<inf>ld</inf>) showed significantly positive correlations with throughfall (P < 0.001) and their average values followed the same order as C. lanceolata > mixed S. superba and C. jenseniana > P. elliottii. The lowest SOC content and the highest DOC<inf>ld</inf> value were observed in pure C. lanceolata stands, which should be well considered when the large-scale reforestation was conducted in the laterite hilly region of southern China. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "In the city of Berlin, artificial groundwater recharge techniques, such as bank filtration and infiltration ponds, are an important source for drinking water production. Climate change with increasing surface water temperatures can influence the water purification processes during bank filtration mainly due the intensification of metabolic processes leading to a decrease of oxygen and an increase of anaerobic conditions. In Lake Tegel a significant increase of water temperature in the epilimnion of 2.4 degrees C within the last 30 years was recorded. For a better understanding of induced bank filtration at Lake Tegel, redox processes and physical-chemical conditions within the surface sediment layers (0-26 cm depth) at the littoral infiltration zone were investigated. The influence of temperature in the range of 0-25 degrees C on microbial catalysis of redox processes, such as reduction of nitrate and sulphate, was examined during the period March 2004 June 2005. High water temperatures (16-25 degrees C) were accompanied by negative redox potentials (E-H = -47 mV) and decreasing N-inorg concentrations, while the amount of ammonia, Mn2+ and Fe2+ was rising. This indicates redox processes such as denitrification, Mn4+ reduction, nitrate respiration and ammonification, as well as Fe3+ reduction. The reduction of sulphate, however, has not yet become significant at Lake Tegel, but with increasing water temperature, sulphate reduction must be expected.\n",

      "Separating temperature and precipitation signals encoded in tree rings is a complicated issue. Here, we present a separation method by combining two tree-ring width chronologies of Schrenk's spruce (Picea schrenkiana) from the upper and lower timberlines in the western Tien Shan Mountains, northwest China. Correlation analyses show that both chronologies correlate positively with precipitation. However, temperature correlates positively with the chronology from the upper timberline, while negatively with the chronology from the lower timberline. This suggests that the two chronologies contain similar precipitation information but opposite temperature signals. In light of this, we calculated the average and difference of the two chronologies, and found that each of them has a much stronger correlation with precipitation or temperature alone. Finally, we reconstructed local precipitation and temperature variations over the past 201 years by using the average and difference of the two chronologies. The two reconstructions do not have a significant correlation, but they have significant positive and negative relationships on the high- and low-frequency band, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "The composition and structure of tree stands near the timberline have been studied on different slopes and at different elevations in the Tylaisko-Konzhakovsko-Serebryanskii Massif, the North Urals. It has been found that the upper limits of tree stands with different degrees of canopy closure have risen considerably (by about 100 m of elevation) since the mid-19th century, although the formation of these stands started as early as the late 18th century. Woodless areas in the eastern part of the massif started to be colonized by Larix sibirica in the late 18th to early 19th centuries; those in the western part, by Picea obovata in the mid-19th century; and in the southern part, by Betula tortuosa in the late 19th century. Analysis of meteorological data provides evidence for warming and increasing humidity of the climate since the late 19th century. Favorable climatic changes that facilitated the expansion of the forest have taken place both in the summer (prolongation of the growing period) and in winter seasons (increase of air temperature and precipitation). The observed differences in the composition and dynamics of tree stands between the studied areas of the mountain range are most probably explained by different requirements of tree species for the depth of snow cover and the degree of soil freezing.\n",

      "Large-area urban ecology studies often miss information on vertical parameters of vegetation, even though they represent important constituting properties of complex urban ecosystems. The new globally available digital elevation model (DEM) of the spaceborne TanDEM-X mission has an unprecedented spatial resolution (12 x 12m) that allows us to derive such relevant information. So far, suitable approaches using a TanDEM-X DEM for the derivation of a normalized canopy model (nCM) are largely absent. Therefore, this paper aims to obtain digital terrain models (DTMs) for the subsequent computation of two nCMs for urban-like vegetation (e.g., street trees) and forest-like vegetation (e.g., parks), respectively, in Berlin, Germany, using a TanDEM-X DEM and a vegetation mask derived from UltraCamX data. Initial comparisons between morphological DTM-filter confirm the superior performance of a novel disaggregated progressive morphological filter (DPMF). For improved assessment of a DTM for urban-like vegetation, a modified DPMF and image enhancement methods were applied. For forest-like vegetation, an interpolation and a weighted DPMF approach were compared. Finally, all DTMs were used for nCM calculation. The nCM for urban-like vegetation revealed a mean height of 4.17 m compared to 9.61 m of a validation nCM. For forest-like vegetation, the mean height for the nCM of the weighted filtering approach (9.16 m) produced the best results (validation nCM: 13.55 m). It is concluded that an nCM from TanDEM-X can capture vegetation heights in their appropriate dimension, which can be beneficial for automated height-related vegetation analysis such as comparisons of vegetation carbon storage between several cities.\n",

Universitas Indonesia, in 2010 has developed an online world universities ranking, aimed to offer the portrait of the current conditions and policies related to green campus and sustainability in the universities all around the world. The aims of this paper are to introduce the development and improvement of UI GreenMetric and evaluate the implementation and result of the year 2011 ranking. The evaluation method used for the ranking performance was a descriptive and qualitative approach, and the Berlin Principles was employed to assess the conformity and quality of UI GreenMetric. The 2011 ranking results show an increment of the number of participating countries. There are more than 25 universities from the United States participated in this ranking. The main prevailing criterion achieved by many universities is the energy and climate change (about 2500 of 2800 maximum score). Most of the indicators in UI GreenMetric are in compliance with the Berlin Principles. The UI GreenMetric ranking provides opportunities for each university to examine their strength and weakness in promoting green university and sustainable development. Further comments and positive feedback from the participating universities will advance the UI GreenMetric ranking system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Based on the cross-dated tree-ring samples collected from the middle Qilian Mountain, a standard ring-width chronology had been developed, which covered the period AD 1000 to 2000. The correlations between the chronology and climatic records from the nearby meteorological stations indicated that temperature was the dominant climatic factor for tree growth at upper timberline, and the most important climatic factor for the tree growth in the area was the mean temperature from previous December to current April. The temperature variations recovered from the ring-width data showed a cold period during the \"Little Ice Age\" and the continuous warming during the twentieth century. Comparison between the ring-width chronology and delta(18)O records from the Dunde ice core in the Qilian Mountain indicated that there was a consistent trend in both time series. A significant correlation existed between our ring-width chronology and the Northern Hemispheric temperature, suggesting that the climate changes in the Qilian Mountain were not only driven by regional factors, but also responsive to the global climate.\n",

      "The Val Fenga in the Central Alps has been selected as the study area of a project comprising palaeoecological and phytosociological investigations, of which the results have been connected. The valley is situated in the border district between Austria and Switzerland. Its geological-geomorphological situation is complicated due to its location in the transition zone of two different geological nappes. The eastern side of the valley is part of the Lower Engadine Window and it is composed by flysch of the Penninic nappes while the western part belongs to the Austroalpine nappes, dominated by the crystalline rocks of the Silvretta massif. As a consequence of the comparatively high degree of hygric continentality the Val Fenga belongs to the climatic region of the Central Alps.To reconstruct the holocene climate and vegetation development palaeobotanical investigations of pear profiles, and in addition, analysis of pollen dispersal have been conducted. The investigations of the actual pollen deposition are made of moss cushions out of the entire investigation area. Different groups of pollen types (''indicator units'') which characterize the representation of different vegetation units and human impact in surface samples are determined by the results of the pollen analysis. The suitability of these units for the judgement of fossile pollen profiles is discussed.The main emphasis of the investigations about the climate and vegetation history was put on the palaeobotanical analysis made of five pear profiles which are situated in a transect from the lower subalpine up to the alpine belt. A survey of the investigated mires is given in Tab. 3. By a synoptic reflection the palynological results of these pear profiles are discussed, and the synchronous effects of climatic change and human impact on the landscape in different altitudes are shown.From the Boreal to the beginning of the Atlantic period a section of high climatic dynamics is shown by the pollen diagrams. During this time, the timberline, which reached almost the altitude of today's alpine belt, was depressed several times. Approximately at the beginning of the older Atlantic period Picea abies immigrated into the region during a section, which is characterized by humid climatic conditions. Sometime later, about 7000 BP, the spruce spread our at the same time the Larch-Arolla pine wood reached its highest extension. Findings of fossile Pinus cembra prove the rise of the Arolla pine to an altitude of about 2400 m asl. During the following time Alnus viridis immigrated into the region as well as Picen abies under more oceanic conditions. But because of the continental climate of the Central Alps, the species only occurs in small amounts since then.Climatic oscillations with only small effects on the timberline characterize the section of the younger Atlantic period. Only in the second half of the younger Atlantic and the following Subboreal period the intensity of the climatic changes increased and also had effects on the subalpine spruce forest. At that time the timberline reached an altitude of today's upper subalpine belt.At the end of the Atlantic period first palynological references of human impact appear, which are intensified during the following section of the Subboreal period, and which were connected with fortified settlements in the Lower Engadin. During the second part of the Subboreal period the pollen diagrams show clearings of the mountain forest downvalley to the lower subalpine belt.By the beginning of the Subatlantic period the human impact became more intensive. Sections of different human impact characterize the diagrams from the Early Middle Age. Since then the lower areas of the Val Fenga also were influenced by this impact. About 1400 BP, 1000 BP and during the period from the 15th to the 19th cent. the human impact culminated. During this time, the mountain forest was extensively destroyed.The area investigated phytosociologically in the middle and upper section of the Val Fenga contains plant communities of fourteen different classes. Basing on their vertical occurrences a separation of the subalpine and alpine belt into three resp. into two zones has been carried out. The description of the various plant communities focusses on rare syntaxa and those which are characterized by their insufficient state of investigation in the Alps up to now.This group includes the relictual Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis which occurs on alluvions, alluvial terraces and fens. In the Val Fenga the alliance is represented by five character species (Carer atrofusca, Carex microglochin, Juncus arcticus, Kobresia simpliciuscula und Tofieldia pusilla) and three associations of different ecological habitats. The Juncetum arctici appears at comparatively dry sites whilst the sparse stands of the Caricetum atrofusco-vaginatae occur on alluvions irrigated by quickly flowing water. The Caricetum microglochinis can be separated into two subassociations: the kobresietosum simpliciusculae on drier habitats and the very wet caricetosum microglochinis. Often a close relationship between the latter unit and stands of Eleocharis quinqueflora can be observed. Due to floristic, syndynamic and habitual reasons the community of Eleocharis has been adjoined as an initial unit to the Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis. As a result of their rarity, threat and the high rate of species mentioned in the Red Lists the communities of the Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis need the uppermost level of protection and conservation. According to investigations about the stratigraphy of pear layers the bryophyte Calliergon trifarium has attained a considerable importance concerning the foundation of the mire communities and the formation of pear in the higher elevated fens of the upper Val Fenga.In small pools becoming temporary dry shallow-water swards constituted by Alopecurus aequalis, Callitriche palustris, Ranunculus trichophyllus ssp. lutulentus und Rorippa mentioned, yet. According to the current knowledge these stands can be classified as Veronico scutellatae-Alopecuretum aequalis within the Littorelletea uniflorae.The very heterogenous composition of species of a special kind of meadows called Hypochoeris uniflora-Nardion strictae-community can be regarded as a consequence of their former irrigation by melted snow water enriched with dung and the decrease of mowing. In the subalpine belt the poorly investigated Chaerophyllo villarsii-Agrostietum schraderianae colonizes scree slopes composed of large rocks of gneisses of the Silvretta crystalline. A subtype of this association including tall herbs and named after Valeriana versifolia occurs on slippery and moist slate slopes. On stable scree slopes the Chaerophyllo villarsii-Agrostietum schraderianae develops to the heath community of the Junipero-Arctostaphyletum. A Chaerophyllum villarsii-subtype of the latter association with Laserpitium halleri, Ranunculus nemorosus s.str., Hieracium hoppeanum und Poa chaixii represents a conspicuous stage of this succession.\n",

      "This paper gives an overview of the Conference on Emerging Policies for European Energy, convened by The Royal Institute of International Affairs in association with The British Institute of Energy Economy and the International Association for Energy Economics, London, 28-29 November 1994. The next four papers in this issue, by Mors, Sterner, Grubb and Tromans, were presented at the Conference.This important Conference started from two assumptions implicit in its title - there is at present no European Union energy policy, and energy policy cannot be considered in isolation from other relevant policies - economic, environmental, employment and social. It was well titled. The European Commission is conducting a major review of energy policy in preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996. It aims to publish a Green Paper soon and a White Paper later in 1995. Environmental policies will come under review at the Berlin Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1995.The Conference fell into four parts. Two opening sessions were mainly concerned with the context in which policies for European energy need to be formulated. The remaining sessions covered the three main issues currently affecting those policies: competition, liberalization, and privatization; environmental issues; and energy security. The relatively short time devoted to the last reflected its declining importance relative to the other issues.\n",

Fans of the Climate Change convention, however, may be disappointed to realise that COP I, scheduled to begin on 28 March 1995 in Berlin, will involve the same cast of characters that dominated the negotiations prior to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, and which have kept the plot dragging during the Convention's 'interim period'. Too much dialogue and not enough action, some would say. How well COP I plays with the public will depend on the ability of the Convention's Parties to make progress on the substantial agenda set in the text of the Convention.\n",

      "This work deals with occurrence, distribution as well as biology and vectorial capacity of the ornate dog tick (Dermacentor (D.) reticulatus). Until 30 years ago this tick has only been described in a few natural foci in southern Germany. Its distribution has however expanded in the course of the last years. With the exception of northern Germany it is now covering large areas of Germany. This is particularly the case in the Upper Rhine Valley, Saarland and the Mark Brandenburg. However, it is endemic in many other areas of Germany as well. The transformation of agricultural land into fallow land, an increase in host reservoirs and climatic changes are discussed as main contributors to this change. Little is known about the role of this species as a vector for virus, rickettsia, bacteria and protozoa as well as its medical and veterinary importance. D. reticulatus is a vector for Babesia canis canis. It is reported here about a case of autochthonous babesiosis in a dog from Berlin/Brandenburg.\n",

      "As a good indicator of Holocene climate, the fluctuation of alpine timberline is a synthetical result of impacts of many environmental factors during geological and historical periods and modern times. As the dominant tree species of mountainous conifer forests on the northern slope of Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, the distribution of Picea schrenkiana and its population size are sensitive to climatic change. The typical natural profile of Huashuwozi and the nearby Xiaoxigou archaeological profile, located in Quanzijie Township, Jimusaer County in Xinjiang, were chosen to analyze and compare the relative high-resolution pollen records, and to measure C-14 dating and SEM (scanning electron microscope) microstructure for charcoal fragments contained in Xiaoxigou profile's cultural layers. The results show that in these two profiles, the high percentages of Picea (more than 20% and 35%, respectively) appeared in the stratum of the same period (2000-1300 a BP), which corresponds to the charcoal fragment's age of Picea schrenkiana contained in Xiaoxigou cultural layers. These results convincingly revealed that during the period of 2000-1300 a BP, the timberline for Picea schrenkiana on the northern slope of Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang declined by about 330m compared with the present.\n",

      "A total of 24 tephra-bearing volcanic layers have been recognized between 550 and 987 m depth in the Siple Dome A (SDM-A) ice core, in addition to a number already recognized tephra in the upper 550 m (Dunbar et al., 2003; Kurbatov et al., 2006). The uniform composition and distinctive morphological of the particles composing these tephra layers suggest deposition as a result of explosive volcanic eruptions and that the layers therefore represent time-stratigraphic markers in the ice core. Despite the very fine grain size of these tephra (mostly less than 20 microns), robust geochemical compositions were determined by electron microprobe analysis. The source volcanoes for these tephra layers are largely found within the Antarctic plate. Statistical geochemical correlations tie nine of the tephra layers to known eruptions from Mt Berlin, a West Antarctic volcano that has been very active for the past 100,000 years. Previous correlations were made to an eruption of Mt. Takahe, another West Antarctic volcano, and one to Mt. Hudson, located in South America (Kurbatov et al., 2006). The lowest tephra layer in the ice core, located at 986.21 m depth, is correlated to a source eruption with an age of 118.1 +/- 1.3 ka, suggesting a chronological pinning point for the lower ice. An episode of anomalously high volcanic activity in the ice in the SDM-A core between 18 and 35 ka (Cow and Meese, 2007) appears to be related to eruptive activity of Mt. Berlin volcano. At least some of the tephra layers found in the SDM-A core appear to be the result of very explosive eruptions that spread ash across large parts of West Antarctica, off the West Antarctic coast, as well as also being recognized in East Antarctica (Basile et al., 2001; Narcisi et al., 2005, 2006). Some of these layers would be expected to should be found in other deep Antarctic ice cores, particularly ones drilled in West Antarctica, providing correlative markers between different cores. The analysis of the tephra layers in the Siple Dome core, along with other Antarctic cores, provides a timing framework for the relatively proximal Antarctic and South American volcanic eruptive events, allowing these to be distinguished from the tropical eruptions that may play a greater role in climate forcing.

      "Afforestation and forest management can increase carbon stocks and account for emission reduction according to the Kyoto Protocol. Site management has important effects on the accumulation of soil carbon after afforestation. This review examines the effects of site management, including soil disturbance, fertilization, thinning, weed control, harvesting and controlled burning, on soil carbon dynamics in plantations, based on recent published results. Soil disturbance can enhance soil carbon losses, with whole ploughing causing the most and disking the least loss of soil carbon. The effects of fertilization and thinning on soil carbon are inconclusive. Weed control can prevent the carbon input from above-ground residue and root turnover and increase soil temperature and soil erosion, which in turn reduces the amount of carbon on the soil surface. Soil carbon decreases with the increase of harvesting intensity and the retention of harvest residue can significantly enhance the accumulation of carbon in the soil. Controlled burning before afforestation has a short-term benefit for soil carbon, but it is not beneficial to the sequestration of soil carbon over the long term. Future studies should focus on investigating the long-term impact of site management practices, especially soil fertilization and thinning, on carbon, identifying the response of major functional pools of soil carbon to management practices, understanding the dynamics of soil nitrogen pools and their role in long-term soil carbon sequestration, as well as quantifying soil carbon processes under different climate conditions and site management scenarios using models. © 2010 Beijing Forestry University and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "To estimate the response of tree vegetation to recent climate warming in the Western Caucasus, the population state of several tree species at the upper limit of their distribution has been estimated in three mountain massifs in the Belaya River basin. For this purpose, the average and maximum stem diameters, vitality, and age of trees have been determined in the transitional zone between middle-mountain and high-mountain beech fir forests (1400-1700 m a.s.l.) and in crooked birch forests growing at the upper timberline (1810 - 2025 m). The upper limits of Acer platanoides, A. pseudoplatanus, Ulmus glabra, and Betula litwinowii have shown a tendency to rise. The upper limit of Abies nordmanniana has remained unchanged over the past few decades, which may be explained by a decrease in moisture supply during the warm season.\n",

      "Dwarf junipers (family Cupressaceae), dioecious and wind-pollinated coniferous shrubs with a low tolerance for shade and a slow growth rate, can be an important biological indicator of climate changes in a mountain environment at a Mediterranean latitude. In the southern Italian mountains they grow at altitudes above 1500 m a.s.l. in wide grazed clearings or over the timberline, and are characteristic of xeric communities, rich in flora and fauna. Nowadays, the conservation of these species is threatened because of the dynamism in the patterns of vegetation and the extremely scarce natural regeneration. This paper presents the initial results of ongoing nursery and laboratory experiments carried out on seed germination and vegetative propagation of autochthonous dwarf junipers (Juniperus hemisphaerica Presl, Juniperus nana Willd.) of the high-mountain areas of Pollino National Park (southern Italy) to promote ex situ conservation. Specific protocols were prepared to break seed dormancy and develop best practices for propagation using cuttings.\n",

      "To estimate whether or not a plant taxon found in the fossil record was locally present may be difficult if only pollen is analyzed. Plant macrofossils, in contrast, provide a clear indication of a taxon's local presence, although in some lake sediments or peats, macrofossils may be rare or degraded. For conifers, the stomata found on pollen slides are derived from needles and thus provide a valuable proxy for local presence and they can be identified to genus level. From previously published studies, a transect across the Alps based on 13 sites is presented. For basal samples in sandy silt above the till with high pollen values of Pinus, for example, we may distinguish pine pollen from distant sources (samples with no stomata), from reworked pollen (samples with stomata present). The first apparent local presence of most conifer genera based on stomata often but not always occurs together with the phase of rapid pollen increase (rational limit). An exception is Larix, with its annual deposition of needles and heavy poorly dispersed pollen, for it often shows the first stomata earlier, at the empirical pollen limit. The decline and potential local extinction of a conifer can sometimes be shown in the stomata record. The decline may have been caused by climatic change, competition, or human impact. In situations where conifers form the timberline, the stomata record may indicate timberline fluctuations. In the discussion of immigration or migration of taxa we advocate the use of the cautious term \"apparent local presence\" to include some uncertainties. Absence of a taxon is impossible to prove.\n",

      "Calcareous pericarps of the tribe Lithospermeae (fam. Boraginaceae) are a common component of archaeobotanical macroremain assemblages in the Mediterranean region. In this study, the relationship between oxygen isotopic composition of fruit biogenic carbonate and climatic conditions was examined. delta(18)O and delta(13)C values of biogenic carbonate were measured in modern Lithospermeae fruits from seven Eurasian sites (Berlin, Kirchentellinsfurt, Gottingen, Athens, Ankara, Tbilisi, and Almaty) and in fossil fruits from three archaeological sites in the eastern Mediterranean (Troy, Kumtepe, and Hirbet ez-Zeragon). Additionally, three (14)C measurements were performed on ancient fruit carbonate from Hirbet ez-Zeracion. The delta(18)O and delta(13)C values varied from 9 to 5 parts per thousand PDB and between 35 and 7 parts per thousand, PDB respectively. In modern fruits, delta(18)O of biogenic carbonate was correlated to local summer precipitation amounts (inversely proportional) and summer air temperatures (proportional). In fossil fruits, the delta(18)O values of carbonate from Troy and Kumtepe were significantly lower than that from Hirbet ez-Zeragon (ca. 5 vs. 2 parts per thousand PDB respectively). The vertical distribution of stable isotopic values and (14)C dates in cultural layers of Hirbet ez-Zeragon indicate that fruit biogenic carbonate can persist in sediment without appreciable diagenetic alteration. These findings suggest that biogenic carbonate of Lithospermeae fruits can be useful as a paleoclimate proxy at least in the Mediterranean. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "This study statistically evaluates the relationship between Antarctic sea ice extent and global climate variability. Temporal cross correlations between detrended Antarctic sea ice edge (SIF) anomaly and Various climate indices are calculated. For the sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern equatorial Pacific and tropical Indian Ocean, as well as the tropical Pacific precipitation, a coherent propagating pattern is clearly evident in all correlations with the spatially averaged (over 12 degrees longitude) detrended SIE anomalies ((SIE*)). Correlations with ENSO indices imply that up to 34% of the variance in (SIE*) is linearly related to ENSO. The (SIE*) has even higher correlations with the tropical Pacific precipitation and SST in the tropical Indian Ocean. In addition, correlation of (SIE*) with global surface temperature produces four characteristic correlation patterns: 1) an ENSO-like pattern in the Tropics with strong correlations in the Indian Ocean and North America (r > 0.6); 2) a teleconnection pattern between the eastern Pacific region of the Antarctic and western-central tropical Pacific; 3) an Antarctic dipole across the Drake Passage; and 4) meridional banding structures in the central Pacific and Atlantic expending from polar regions to the Tropics, even to the Northern Hemisphere.The SIE anomalies in the Amundsen Sea, Berlingshausen Sea, and Weddell Gyre of the Antarctic polar ocean sectors show the strongest polar links to extrapolar climate. Linear correlations between (SIE*) in those regions and global climate parameters pass a local significance test at the 95% confidence lever. The field significance, designed to account for spatial coherence in the surface temperature, is evaluated using quasiperiodic colored noise that is more appropriate than white noise. The fraction of the globe displaying locally significant correlations (at the 95% confidence level) between (SIE*) and global temperature is significantly larger, at the 99.5% confidence level, than the fraction expected given quasiperiodic colored noise in place of the (SIE*). Based on EOF analysis and multiplicity theory, the four teleconnection patterns the authors found are the ones reflecting correlations most likely to be physically meaningful.\n",

      "Medical and health researchers have shown that fatalities during heat waves are most commonly due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, primarily from heat's negative effect on the cardiovascular system. In an attempt to control one's internal temperature, the body's natural instinct is to circulate large quantities of blood to the skin. However, to perform this protective measure against overheating actually harms the body by inducing extra strain on the heart. This excess strain has the potential to trigger a cardiac event in those with chronic health problems, such as the elderly, Cui et al. Frumkin showed that the relationship of mortality and temperature creates a J-shaped function, showing a steeper slope at higher temperatures. Records show that more casualties have resulted from heat waves than hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes together. This statistic's significance is that extreme heat events (EHEs) are becoming more frequent, as shown by Stone et al. Their analysis shows a growth trend of EHEs by 0.20 days/year in U.S. cities between 1956 and 2005, with a 95% confidence interval and uncertainty of +/- 0.6. This means that there were 10 more days of extreme heat conditions in 2005 than in 1956. Studies held from 1989 to 2000 in 50 U. S. cities recorded a rise of 5.7% in mortality during heat waves. The research of Schifano et al. revealed that Rome's elderly population endures a higher mortality rate during heat waves, at 8% excess for the 65-74 age group and 15% for above 74. Even more staggering is findings of Dousset et al. on French cities during the 2003 heat wave. Small towns saw an average excess mortality rate of 40%, while Paris witnessed an increase of 141%. During this period, a 0.5 degrees C increase above the average minimum nighttime temperature doubled the risk of death in the elderly. Heat-related illnesses and mortality rates have slightly decreased since 1980, regardless of the increase in temperatures. Statistics from the U. S. Census state that the U. S. population without air conditioning saw a drop of 32% from 1978 to 2005, resting at 15%. Despite the increase in air conditioning use, a study done by Kalkstein through 2007 proved that the shielding effects of air conditioning reached their terminal effect in the mid-1990s. Kan et al. hypothesize in their study of Shanghai that the significant difference in fatalities from the 1998 and 2003 heat waves was due to the increase in use of air conditioning. Protective factors have mitigated the danger of heat on those vulnerable to it, however projecting forward the heat increment related to sprawl may exceed physiologic adaptation thresholds. It has been studied and reported that urban heat islands (UHI) exist in the following world cities and their countries and/or states: Tel-Aviv, Israel, Newark, NJ, Madrid, Spain, London, UK, Athens, Greece, Taipei, Taiwan, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Osaka, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Beijing, China, Pyongyang, North Korea, Bangkok, Thailand, Manila, Philippines, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Seoul, South Korea, Muscat, Oman, Singapore, Houston, USA, Shanghai, China, Wroclaw, Poland, Mexico City, Mexico, Arkansas, Atlanta, USA, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Kenya, Brisbane, Australia, Moscow, Russia, Los Angeles, USA, Washington, DC, USA, San Diego, USA, New York, USA, Chicago, USA, Budapest, Hungary, Miami, USA, Istanbul, Turkey, Mumbai, India, Shenzen, China, Thessaloniki, Greece, Rotterdam, Netherlands, Akure, Nigeria, Bucharest, Romania, Birmingham, UK, Bangladesh, and Delhi, India.The strongest being Shanghai, Bangkok, Beijing, Tel-Aviv, and Tokyo with UHI intensities (UHII) of 3.5-7.0, 3.0-8.0, 5.5-10, 10, and 12 degrees C, respectively. Of the above world cities, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Delhi, Bangladesh, London, Kyoto, Osaka, and Berlin have been linked to increased mortality rates due to the heightened temperatures of nonheat wave periods. Chan et al. studied excess mortalities in cities such as Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Delhi, which currently observe mortality increases ranging from 4.1% to 5.8% per 1 degrees C over a temperature threshold of approximately 29 degrees C. Goggins et al. found similar data for the urban area of Bangladesh, which showed an increase of 7.5% in mortality for every 1 degrees C the mean temperature was above a similar threshold. In the same study, while observing microregions of Montreal portraying heat island characteristics, mortality was found to be 28% higher in heat island zones on days with a mean temperature of 26 degrees C opposed to 20 degrees C compared to a 13% increase in colder areas.\n",

      "In large cities such as Berlin, human mortality rates increase during intense heat waves. Analysis of relevant data from north-eastern Germany revealed that, during the heat waves that occurred between 1990 and 2006, health risks were higher for older people in both rural and urban areas, but that, during the two main heat waves within that 17-year period of time, the highest mortality rates were from the city of Berlin, and in particular from its most densely built-up districts. Adaptation measures will need to be developed, particularly within urban areas, in order to cope with the expected future intensification of heat waves due to global climate change.

      "Global climate change and sustained urban growth have increased the necessity of assessing the role that urban vegetation plays in urban dwellers' lives, as well as in urban ecosystem services. Urban environmental studies, however, still lack methods to characterize urban vegetation with adequate detail and across large areas. To remedy this gap, we apply a Support-Vector-Machine approach to classify eight frequent tree genera in the capital city of Berlin, Germany. We investigate different spectral and temporal band combinations of five RapidEye images acquired during the 2009 phenological season, and use ancillary surface and terrain models for orthorectification and improved tree masking. Results show that intra-annual time-series of RapidEye data can be used for high-precision tree genera classification in an urban environment. Differences within RapidEye time-series correlate well with empirical phenological studies of different tree genera, and RapidEye's red-edge band supports class separability. Further assessment is needed on the individual tree level and mixed stands regarding the quality of mapping urban individual trees, as our sampling approach mainly focused on larger stands with only a single tree genus. Urban applications will benefit from multitemporal RapidEye data, which offers area-wide monitoring and allows in-depth vegetation analysis to augment existing assessments. Such information is indispensable for assessing differences in urban ecosystem services related to carbon storage, cooling or air filtering, all of which differ between tree species. Therefore, the importance of in-depth analyses of urban vegetation cannot be underestimated in today's context of climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The mean radiant temperature (T-mrt) is the most complex variable regarding the input parameters for heat balance models of human being that are the background for the assessment of thermally unfavourable conditions and heat stress. This paper investigates the simplification of past studies that the T-mrt is equal to the air temperature (T-a) under indoor conditions. In a second step, the causes for deviations between the two parameters are examined and integrated into the context of indoor climate. Measurements were conducted in four rooms at the Geography Department of Humboldt University in Berlin during autochthonal weather conditions from the 16th of August to the 2nd of September 2013. T-mrt was derived using integral radiation measurements and three different types of globe thermometers.The study indicates that the deviations between the different methods of obtaining T-mrt are negligible for indoor environments. The results show that the differences between T-a and T-mrt are negligible during most periods, as stated in previous literature. As air temperatures increase, however, T-mrt exceeds T-a up to 1.3 K. The examination of the surface temperatures indicates that rooms with window walls facing southeast and southwest show the largest disparities between T-a and T-mrt. The correlation between T-a and T-mrt and the sum of the short and long wave radiation specifies the radiation intensity and duration as the main driver of T-mrt. Future studies on indoor heat stress should hence consider that T-mrt and T-a can differ depending on the characteristics of the room and on solar radiation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

      "The likelihood of occurrence of extreme high-temperature run events is estimated for different values of the event intensity and persistence from very long synthetic time series of daily maximum temperatures generated by Monte Carlo simulations using a first-order autoregressive or Markov model. A theoretical analysis reveals a higher relative sensitivity of the simulated extreme event probabilities to changes in the variability of climate than to changes in its mean state. Moreover, this sensitivity relatively increases at a nonlinear rate the more extreme the event. The developed probabilistic model is applied in order to derive local scenarios of extreme high-temperature run events for a large conurbation like the city of Berlin assuming both arbitrary hypothetical and physically based new climate states described by changes in the model parameters (e.g. the mean, the standard deviation and the first-order autocorrelation of the daily maximum temperature time series). As a consequence of a 1.7 degrees C increase in the mean as well as a 19% increase in the temperature variability in July as predicted by the climate model ECHAM-1/LSG assuming an unrestricted future increase in the global atmospheric concentration of climate relevant greenhouse gases according to the IPCC Scenario A (\"Business as usual\") the intensity as well as the persistence of extreme high-temperature run events will rise considerably up to the end of the next century. In particular, intense hot spells characterized by at least five consecutive daily maximum temperatures equaling or exceeding 33 degrees C are expected to occur every eight years under the new climate conditions compared to a current repetition time of about 47 years. The potential environmental effects might be a significant increase in the heat-stress-related morbidity and mortality rate, an aggravation of the summer smog situation and a destabilization of the urban ecosystems.

      "Forests both take up CO(2) and enhance absorption of solar radiation, with contrasting effects on global temperature. Based on a 9-year study in the forests' dry timberline, we show that substantial carbon sequestration (cooling effect) is maintained in the large dry transition zone (precipitation from 200 to 600 millimeters) by shifts in peak photosynthetic activities from summer to early spring, and this is counteracted by longwave radiation (L) suppression (warming effect), doubling the forestation shortwave (S) albedo effect. Several decades of carbon accumulation are required to balance the twofold S + L effect. Desertification over the past several decades, however, contributed negative forcing at Earth's surface equivalent to similar to 20% of the global anthropogenic CO(2) effect over the same period, moderating warming trends.\n",

      "1. The responses of nutrient concentrations, plankton, macrophytes and macrozoobenthos to a reduction in external nutrient loading and to contemporary climatic change were studied in the shallow, moderately flushed Lake Muggelsee (Berlin, Germany). Weekly to biweekly data from 1979 to 2003 were compared with less frequently collected historical data.2. A reduction of more than 50% in both total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) loading from the hypertrophic (1979-90) to the eutrophic period (1997-2003) was followed by an immediate decline in TN concentrations in the lake. TP concentrations only declined during winter and spring. During summer, phosphorus (P) release from the sediments was favoured by a drastic reduction in nitrate import. Therefore, Muggelsee acted as a net P source for 6 years after the external load reduction despite a mean water retention time of only 0.1-0.16 years.3. Because of the likely limitation by P in spring and nitrogen (N) in summer, phytoplankton biovolume declined immediately after nutrient loading was reduced. The formerly dominant cyanobacteria (Oscillatoriales) Limnothrix redekei and Planktothrix agardhii disappeared, but the mean biovolume of the N-2-fixing species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae remained constant.4. The abundance of Daphnia spp. in summer decreased by half, while that of cyclopoid copepod species increased. Abundances of benthic macroinvertebrates (mainly chironomids) decreased by about 80%. A resource control of both phytoplankton and zooplankton is indicated by significant positive correlations between nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biovolume and between phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass.5. Water transparency in spring increased after nutrient reduction and resulted in re-colonisation of the lake by Potamogeton pectinatus. However, this process was severely hampered by periphyton shading and grazing by waterfowl and fish.6. Water temperatures in Muggelsee have increased in winter, early spring and summer since 1979. The earlier development of the phytoplankton spring bloom was associated with shorter periods with ice cover, while direct temperature effects were responsible for the earlier development of the daphnid maximum in spring.\n",

      "New palynological, radiocarbon, and stable isotope data from Castle Peak in the southern Coast Mountains indicate that the early Holocene climate of southern British Columbia was warmer and perhaps drier than today. Fossil wood fragments are common above timberline at Castle Peak and have yielded 13 radiocarbon ages ranging from 9.1 ka to 8.1 ka. This evidence for higher timberline during the early Holocene is in agreement with pollen data indicating a warmer and possibly longer summer growing season in this area during the early Holocene, and is consistent with theoretical considerations based on Milankovitch forcing of climate change. The oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition of fossil wood cellulose is similar to that of living trees in the same area. Growing season relative humidity values derived from the isotopic data provide some support for episodes of dryness at times of elevated timberline, although the majority of paleohumidity estimates fall within the range of modern moisture levels.\n",

      "Distinct radial growth reductions in Cembran pine (Pinus cembra L.) were studied at the timberline on Mt. Patscherkofel (2246 m a.s.l., Tyrol, Austria), which is situated in the inner-Alpine dry region of the Central Austrian Alps. Six timberline stands with different aspects were sampled and ring-width chronologies developed based on dendroecological techniques. Growth-climate relationships between residual chronologies and climate variables were explored using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients. P. cembra growth at the timberline appears to be limited by cool summer (June-August) and previous autumn (September-October) temperatures and low precipitation in late winter (March). Timberline stands show concurrent growth depressions lasting >= 5 yr during the periods 1815-1823, 1851-1858 and 1913-1920, indicating growth depressions were steadily decreasing. Although evaluation of climate data revealed that these growth depressions can mainly be explained by occurrence of cold growing seasons and therefore the influence of recent climate warming on tree growth is plausible, an effect of tree ageing on climate sensitivity may also be involved. On the other hand, climate extremes do not inevitably induce growth responses as would be expected from growth-climate relationships. This is explained by the occurrence of synergistic and/or compensating effects of growth limiting climate variables and preconditioning of tree growth in previous years. Comparison of growth reductions with two published P. cembra timberline chronologies from inner-Alpine dry locations in the Eastern Alps revealed that investigated stands show the highest climate sensitivity during the last 200 yr. This difference in growth response to climate variability is most probably related to the special climate situation at Mt. Patscherkofel, which is exceptionally windy throughout the year and frequently exposed to warm dry winds (Fohn).\n",

      "Subfossil pollen from two bogs in temperature-sensitive, high-altitude regions were analysed in order to reconstruct early- to mid-Holocene summer temperature fluctuations in the Eastern Alps. The pollen records showed four centennial-scale cooling intervals with low growing-season temperatures, Resulting in decreasing pollen production and/or lower treeline position during the period 9000 - 6000 cal. BP. For the first time, the 8200 cal. BP cold event and an equivalent to the Misox cold phase in the Swiss Alps were detected in the Eastern Alps. The oscillations recorded in the pollen curves for Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra) and sedges (Cyperaceae) at c. 8200 cal. BP match, in time and magnitude, the delta(18)O excursion in the Greenland GRIP ice-core record as well as sea- surface cooling in the North Atlantic. The close congruence between the pollen records covering 3000 years and climate proxy-data from both Hemispheres indicates that large-scale environmental changes, possibly caused by North Atlantic freshwater pulses and/or fluctuations in solar activity, caused decreases in pollen production and/ or treeline shifts in the Alps. Although the 8200 cal. BP climatic deterioration was of a global character, its impact on biological productivity of temperature-sensitive sites at high altitude has only rarely been demonstrated. The data indicate that pollen analyses near and above the timberline within high-altitude, herb-dominated plant communities are of considerable and yet largely unexplored potential to detect abrupt short-term as well as long-term climatic variations.\n",

On the mountain slopes studied, an upward shift of the timberline took place in areas covered in winter with thick snow (in the late 18th century), with Siberian larch being the pioneer species. Larch began colonizing areas with a thin snow cover in the 20th century. Birch appeared later and has since strengthened its positions.

      "Questions: What was the main trigger of treeline ecotone advance - rising temperature or agricultural land abandonment? Were the triggering factors of tree expansion homogeneous or did they differ between upper and lower parts of the treeline ecotone?Location: Sudetes Mts., Central Europe (50 degrees N, 15-17 degrees E).Methods: Data were gathered from the treeline ecotone formed by Picea abies at elevations ranging from 1250 to 1490 m. The study area experienced a 1 degrees C temperature increase over the last 100 yr and termination of cattle grazing and grass mowing in the first half of the 20th century. At 38 plots situated at lower ('timberline') and middle or upper ('treeline' and 'outpost treeline') parts of the treeline ecotone, the age structure of all seed origin P. abies was determined. Changes in tree cover and number of trees over the last 60-70 yr were assessed from aerial imagery. The history of agricultural land use for each plot was compiled. Finally, changes in tree establishment were modelled using climatic variables and land-use intensity.Results: We found that tree establishment at treeline had occurred with a 30-40-yr lag after the main establishment peak at timberline. Whereas all treeline plots showed gradual increases in tree cover, timberline tree cover first increased, with some plots then undergoing thinning. Enhanced tree establishment was dependent mainly upon agricultural land abandonment. The effect of land-use changes was more important in the lower than in the upper part of the treeline ecotone. Increasing summer temperatures had a negative influence on seedling establishment in the last few decades.Conclusions: Treeline ecotone densification was attributable to agricultural land abandonment across the entire treeline ecotone with the most important effect at timberline. More recently, seedling establishment has been limited by the effects of drought and/or absence of suitable microsites. We documented that one or two establishment pulses over 120 yr, together with enhanced growth since the 1980s, were able to trigger treeline ecotone advance.\n",

      "The Andes provide an extensive latitudinal and topographical framework for studying the factors that control the spatial patterns of forests (timberlines) and their species components expressed through the presence of tree growth forms ( tree lines). Despite consistent overall similarities in landscape patterns, many processes must be unique, given the dramatic differences in species richness and biophysical constraints along the Andes. In all cases evaluated to date, morphological plasticity is a common trait of plant species that dominate at tree lines. In fact, many changes observed can be related to species- specific traits. Physiological limitations on tree growth form only explain species limits, while disturbances and cyclical climate fluctuations interact to affect many landscape patterns. Over long periods of time, tree lines provide unique habitats and perhaps opportunities for speciation. Understanding the spatial organization of tree-line dynamics is one viable research approach for evaluating the likely past fluxes and possible future changes.\n",

Applying a spatially explicit model, tree occurrence is predicted as a function of high resolution and physiologically relevant biophysical variables. The study shows that warming only slightly alters the overall abundance of tree species. However, the preferred temperature regimes are unevenly distributed along an elevational gradient. and the sensitivity to temperature varies considerably between the species. As a result, major reorganizations of forests in montane and subalpine belts are expected, i.e., a segregation of the core distributions of Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies is observed. Tree distribution potentials near timberlines, however, remain roughly the same.\n",

      "A controversial debate is going on about the steps necessary to ensure sustainable economic development in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Social Democratic Parry (SPD) demands a national environmental plan with binding data for the consumption of resources and land as well as for pollutant loads. However this would mean going the way of an economy managed by ecology. A decision along these lines would hardly be able to make Germany, as a location of industrial production, fit for the increasingly tougher international competition.The federal government assigns priority to a concept of small steps in climate protection. At the Environmental Summit in Berlin in the spring of 1995, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised a 25% decrease of German carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions between 1990 and 2005. By international comparison with initiatives for CO2 reduction this is an ambitious target On the one hand, it contains a binding quantitative promise where most countries avoid such verifiable statements; on the other hand the reduction rate promised is relatively high. Worldwide, a major success is seen in the possibility for the industrialized countries merely to stabilize their CO2 emissions.Even though considerable progress has been made in this country since the early nineties, the CO2 reduction level envisaged for political reasons remains threatened Compared to 1990 as the base line year, CO2 emissions in the Federal Republic by the middle of this decade have been reduced by more than 130 million tons, i. e. 13%. However, this decrease is due to the drastic decline in particularly CO2-intensive production processes in the new German federal states. In Eastern Germany, especially the use of lignite, with its relatively high carbon dioxide fractions, has been reduced.A number of aspects need to be taken into account. The reductions promised in voluntary agreements for cooperation between industry and the federal government are an important step in the right direction. Energy tares based on emissions should be introduced only on the basis of a calculable schedule, in small steps and, if possible, in an internationally harmonized approach in order to protect long-term investments. In this way, longer-term incentives could be offered in the interest of environmentally benign innovations and investments already at the stage of industrial planning.Should nuclear power, which produces no CO2 emissions, be abandoned on political grounds, the national costs of such a switch would be likely to reach amounts in the double or three-digit billions. The operation of German nuclear power plants at present allows some 150 million tons of CO2 to be avoided annually. If new reactors could be built in the future without ally political obstacles, additional CO2 savings potentials could be mobilized.\n",

      "Climate change is associated with earth radiation budget that depends upon incoming solar radiation, surface albedo and radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. Human activities are contributing to climate change by causing changes in Earth's atmosphere (greenhouse gases, aerosols) and biosphere (deforestation, urbanization, irrigation). Long term and precise measurements from calibrated global observation constellation is a vital component in climate system modelling. Space based records of biosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere over more than three decades are providing important information on climate change. Space observations are an important source of climate variables due to multi scale simultaneous observation (local, regional, and global scales) capability with temporal revisit in tune with requirements of land, ocean and atmospheric processes. Essential climatic variables that can be measured from space include atmosphere (upper air temperature, water vapour, precipitation, clouds, aerosols, GHGs etc.), ocean (sea ice, sea level, SST, salinity, ocean colour etc.) and land (snow, glacier, albedo, biomass, LAI/fAPAR, soil moisture etc.). India's Earth Observation Programme addresses various aspects of land, ocean and atmospheric applications. The present and planned missions such as Resourcesat-1, Oceansat-2, RISAT, Megha-Tropiques, INSAT-3D, SARAL, Resourcesat-2, Geo-HR Imager and series of Environmental satellites (I-STAG) would help in understanding the issues related to climate changes. The paper reviews observational needs, space observation systems and studies that have been carried out at ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) towards mapping/detecting the indicators of climate change, monitoring the agents of climate change and understanding the impact of climate change, in national perspectives. Studies to assess glacier retreat, changes in polar ice cover, timberline change and coral bleaching are being carried out towards monitoring of climate change indicators. Spatial methane inventories from paddy rice, livestock and wetlands have been prepared and seasonal pattern of CO(2), and CO have been analysed. Future challenges in space observations include design and placement of adequate and accurate multi-platform observational systems to monitor all parameters related to various interaction processes and generation of long term calibrated climate data records pertaining to land ocean and atmosphere.\n",

Recent paleoecological studies have revealed regional variation in the upward shift of timberlines in the Northern and Central European Alps in response to rapid warming at the Younger Dryas/Preboreal transition ca. 11700years ago, probably caused by a climatic gradient across the Alps. This contrasts with previous studies that successfully simulated the early Holocene afforestation in the (warmer) Central Alps with a chironomid-inferred temperature reconstruction from the (colder) Northern Alps. We use LandClim, a dynamic landscape vegetation model to simulate mountain forests under different temperature, soil and precipitation scenarios around Iffigsee (2065m a.s.l.) a lake in the Northwestern Swiss Alps, and compare the model output with the paleobotanical records. The model clearly overestimates the upward shift of timberline in a climate scenario that applies chironomid-inferred July-temperature anomalies to all months. However, forest establishment at 9800 cal. BP at Iffigsee is successfully simulated with lower moisture availability and monthly temperatures corrected for stronger seasonality during the early Holocene. The model-data comparison reveals a contraction in the realized niche of Abies alba due to the prominent role of anthropogenic disturbance after ca. 5000 cal. BP, which has important implications for species distribution models (SDMs) that rely on equilibrium with climate and niche stability. Under future climate projections, LandClim indicates a rapid upward shift of mountain vegetation belts by ca. 500m and treeline positions of ca. 2500m a.s.l. by the end of this century. Resulting biodiversity losses in the alpine vegetation belt might be mitigated with low-impact pastoralism to preserve species-rich alpine meadows.\n",

      "Global climate change alters the relationship between temperature and light in aquatic ecosystems, which is expected to affect the success of different phytoplankton species. To examine this, the interactions between temperature, photoperiod and light exposure (LE) (integral daily light supply) on specific growth rates were analysed for Limnothrix redekei, Planktothrix agardhii (cyanobacteria), Nitzschia acicularis and Stephanodiscus minutulus (diatoms). A model of factor interactions was developed based on new (P. agardhii and St. minutulus) and previously published laboratory studies. It describes the measured data with high precision. Temperature and photoperiod affect the parameters of the light-growth response curve differently, but these effects are the same for all species. The link between functions for temperature and photoperiod is more species-specific. Using meteorological data, the model developed here was used to study the interplay of these factors during a spring bloom in Lake Muggelsee (Berlin). It was found that while all three factors influenced phytoplankton growth, temperature and photoperiod were more important than LE. Both the intensities of the factors and the interactions between them influenced each species to a different degree. The results may help improve our understanding and ability to predict shifts in phytoplankton communities caused by weather patterns and climate change.\n",

      "The challenges posed by the energy turnaround in Germany to the power industry and the national economy after the Fukushima events were the topic of the Energy in a Dialog\" meeting organized by the Deutsches Atomforum in Berlin on December 14, 2011.Dr. Ralf Guldner, President of the Deutsches Atomforum, opened the conference by drawing attention to the real purposes of the energy turnaround, namely to prevent severe climate changes and, thus, also carbon emissions. Both nationally in Germany and worldwide, nuclear power made major contributions to achieving these goals. Referring to developments in many neighboring countries, he underlined that opting out of the use of nuclear power in Germany was not tantamount to the end of nuclear power. Reality in energy policy had to be accepted, however, namely that nuclear power played, and would go on playing, an important role in Europe.Other contributions by Dr. Jurgen Grossmann (Chief Executive Officer of RWE AG), Stefan Kohler (Chairman of the Board of Management of the German Energy Agency dena), and Prof.Dr. Felix Musgens (Brandenburg Technical University of Cottbus, Chair of Power Economics) dealt with political and other boundary conditions required for the energy turnaround, and with the consequences and burdens on the power industry and the national economy.A final panel discussion chaired by Henning Krumrey (Wirtschaftswoche) was attended by F.

      "This work quantified the total carbon and 12 other sediment characteristics at 10 soil depths, in planted and or natural mangrove forests in comparison with non-vegetated soil for four seasons of the year 2009–2010 in the Vellar-Coleroon estuarine complex, India. The sediment characteristics varied significantly between mangrove-vegetated and non-vegetated habitats or seasons of analysis, but not between soil depths. The mangrove sediments were rich in total carbon and total organic carbon as compared to non-mangrove sediments (p <0.01). Total carbon was 98.2% higher in mature mangroves and 41.8% in planted mangroves than that in non-mangrove soil. Total organic carbon was as much as 2.5 times greater in mature mangroves and 2 times greater in planted mangroves than that in unvegetated soil. Carbon contents also varied many fold by season. Total carbon content was 8.6 times greater during pre-monsoon, 4.1 times greater during post-monsoon and 2.5 times greater during monsoon than during summer (p<0.01 in all cases). Similarly, total organic carbon was 5.9 times greater during pre-monsoon, 3.1 times greater during post-monsoon and 69% greater during monsoon than during summer. In general, higher levels of sediment carbon were recorded during pre and post-monsoon seasons than during other seasons. Total carbon concentration was correlated negatively to temperature, sand and phosphorus (p <0.01); positively correlated with redox potential, silt, clay, C/N ratio, potassium (p <0.01) and nitrogen (p <0.05); but not correlated with soil depth, pH or salinity. This work revealed that the carbon burial was rapid at the annual rate of 2.8% for total carbon, and 6.7% for total organic carbon in mangrove-planted sediment. Clearing of mangroves can result in significantly and rapidly reduced carbon stores. Our study highlights the importance of natural and plantation mangrove stands for conserving sediment carbon in the tropical coastal domain. © 2014, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "We propose a technique for separating the climatic signal which is contained in two tree-ring parameters widely used in dendroclimatology. The method is based on the removal of the relationship between tree-ring width (TRW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) observed for narrow tree rings from high latitudes. The new technique is tested on data from three larch stands located along the northern timberline in Eurasia. Correlations were calculated between the temperatures of pentads ( five consecutive days), TRWchronologies and MXD chronologies calculated according to the standard and proposed methods. The analysis confirms the great importance of summer temperature for tree radial growth and tree-ring formation. TRW is positively correlated with the temperature of four to eight pentads ( depending on the region) at the beginning of the growth season, but MXD as obtained by the standard technique is correlated with temperature over a much longer period. For maximum density series from which the relationship between MXD and TRW has been removed (MXD'), there is a clear correlation with temperatures in the second part of the growing season. These results are consistent with the known dynamics of tree-ring growth in high latitudes and mechanisms of tree-ring formation.\n",

      "The original light-brown sandy seam filling of pavements in urban areas turns dark and changes its properties by the time due to various inputs of urban dust. Deposited C-org inputs do mostly not have natural characteristics but are man-made, e.g., diesel dust. Thus, properties of the seam material are not predictable from experiences with forest or agricultural soils. Semiperviously sealed urban areas are sites of contaminant deposition as well as groundwater recharge. For an assessment of the resulting groundwater-contamination risk in these areas, the properties of the seam material, which influences transport processes, must be known. The aim of this study was to investigate the pore-system build-up, which includes size distribution and fractal character in the seam material of urban sites. The investigated samples were taken from pavements adjacent to roads in Berlin and Warsaw.The micropore parameters (nanometer range) were characterized using water-vapor desorption isotherms, mesopore parameters (micrometer range) were estimated from mercury-intrusion porosimetry and macropore parameters (millimeter range) from water-retention curves. Particle density, dry bulk density, and particle-size distribution were measured using standard methods. Volumes of micro- and mesopores as well as particle densities and dry bulk densities correlated with C-tot contents. However, no such relation was found for macropore volumes. Compared to the original sandy seam filling, the altered seam material shows significantly higher C-org contents and higher amounts of micro- and mesopores. Therefore, the available water capacity increases by 0.05-0.11 m(3) m(-3), as compared to the original sandy seam filling. Compared to natural sandy soils having similar C-org contents, the seam material shows similar macropore volumes, but the volume of mesopores and micropores is a few times smaller. That is mainly because of the particulate character of the organic matter.\n",

      "Climate change has huge impacts on alpine ecosystems. One of the most visible effects in the Alps is glacier retreat since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA), which caused the exposure of previously glaciated surfaces. These surfaces are open-air laboratories, verifying theories regarding ecosystem and soil development.In order to increase our knowledge on the effects of time and vegetation primary succession on soil development in proglacial areas, we sampled soils and surveyed plant communities on stable points in the proglacial area of the Lys glacier, in the Italian north-western Alps (Valle d'Aosta Region). The sampling points were located on dated sites (based on literature and/or historical photographs).Glacial till is attacked by weathering processes immediately after deposition and stabilization, with a consequent loss of soluble compounds, decrease of pH and primary mineral weathering. The speed of these processes was largely increased after the establishment of a continuous vegetation cover, thanks to the organic matter accumulation caused by litter input and root decomposition below the soil surface.On sialic glacial tills, below timberline and under a quasi-climax larch-Rhododendron forest, fast and steady decrease in pH values, increase in organic matter content and horizon differentiation were observed. In particular, genetic eluvial horizons formed in approximately 60 years, while diagnostic albic horizons were developed after ca. 90 years, pointing to an early start of the podzolization processes. Cheluviations of Fe and, secondarily, Al were analytically verified. However, illuviations of Fe, Al and organic matter in incipient B horizons were not sufficient to obtain diagnostic spodic horizons on LIA materials.Under grazed grassland below timberline and alpine prairie above timberline, acidification and weathering were slightly slower, and no redistribution with the depths of Fe and Al oxi-hydroxides was observed. A cambic Bw horizon developed on the oldest LIA moraines.Therefore it seemed that this fast onset of the podzolization process in comparison to other proglacial chronosequences in the Alps was mainly driven by vegetation properties rather than by specific climatic conditions.

      "The periodicity of climatic processes in the Barents Sea Region and along the Arctic Ocean coast during several hundred years has been studied by analyzing the tree-ring chronologies for the regions close to the northern timberline. In the Barents Sea region, cyclicities of climatic processes with periods of around 90, 30-35, 22-23, 18 and 11-12 years have been established by spectral analysis of the data for the Kola Peninsula. Wavelet analysis of annual series of conifer tree-rings generalized for 10 regions along the northern timberline, from the Kola Peninsula to Chukotka, for the period 1458-1975 has revealed the same periodicities for the vast areas of northern Russia. Climatic cyclicity with a period of about 35 years is known as the Bruckner cycle. Climatic cycles with periods of around 90, 22-23 and 11-12 years correlate well with the corresponding solar activity cycles. A possible solar forcing of periodic climatic processes and its nonlinear influence on the atmosphere-ocean-continental system are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Since humans are preferentially settling in flood plains they often influence freshwater systems intensely. The first signs of anthropogenic impacts on surface waters in the Berlin-Brandenburg region are approximately 3000 years old. Considering the multiple and intense human uses of surface waters in this region, we analysed when, how and to which extent regional rivers and streams became impacted by dams, water mills and fish weirs resulting in changes in morphology, hydrology and ecological functioning. We hypothesise that the development and growth of cities in this region necessitated (1) efficient navigability of rivers linking them, (2) efficient use of hydropower resources for mills, and (3) significant pollution of surface waters especially with the beginning of industrial development. We analyse these hypotheses by means of three regional examples and delineate the effects of human uses on selected surface water bodies. Understanding the effects of these historic modifications of surface water supports the identification of options for a sustainable use of surface waters that are currently still subjected to multiple uses but face a significant decrease in discharge due to climate change.\n",

      "My comment on Ethics in an Age of Technology, volume 2 of Ian G. Barbour's Gifford Lectures, acknowledges the excellence of Barbour's depictions of the social-cum-technological problems facing humanity in the coming millennium. Barbour's proposed solutions, too, are reasonable - but usually presuppose fundamental reforms in social values, especially within the powerful industrialized societies. Without further analysis of technology and values, this seems to make such solutions ''impossible dreams.'' My thesis is that clear analysis of the ideal aspects of technology (as itself the embodiment of knowledge and values), plus clues from Alfred North Whitehead on the dynamics of social change, can reinforce hope even in ''impossible'' dreams. First, technology, though embodied in solid material machinery and powerful social institutions, is no more ''solid'' than constant reaffirmation of the values behind it (as was the case with the Berlin Wall). Second, great ideals, over time, have the power to help create the conditions of their own possibility. Social change is both ''pushed'' by coercive forces (e.g., climate changes) and ''pulled'' by great values (e.g., human dignity). Therefore there are practical benefits to be gained from attending to, and celebrating, even currently ''impossible'' dreams as they work to make themselves possible.\n",

The measured growth series were standardized using 67% splines. A height-increment chronology was built by averaging the indices. This chronology was further divided into high- and low-frequency components using reciprocal filters. Among the temperature variables, mean July temperature of the previous year correlated most significantly with height growth. We compared several simple linear reconstruction models based on the three height-growth chronologies (the unfiltered, high-pass and low-pass filtered chronologies) individually as predictors of the mean July temperature. The high-frequency reconstruction showed superior model performance in calibrations. However, only calibrations using climate data from the nearest Ivalo station were time stable and showed reasonable reconstruction skill. The coefficient of determination (R(2)) in the final model during calibration period (1958-1998) is 0.67. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Invasion of the tall grass Brachypodium genuense was observed in an area of the central Apennines (Italy) where the population size of Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) was in strong decline. Since this dominant tall grass threatens biodiversity and forage quality, our hypothesis was that B. genuense abundance influenced that of palatable species for the chamois, depending on their functional traits and distribution patterns. Our sampling design used plots of 10 x 10 m and 1 x 1 m to investigate the plant community level and fine-scale interactions. We analyzed data using correlation, generalized linear models, and redundancy analyses. We found that B. genuense can reach high abundance values on the deepest soils. Its high cover value influences plant community composition by competitive exclusion of subordinate species and suppression of functional features because of temporal or spatial niche overlap. This leads to low cover of palatable species at a fine scale, and to poor pasture quality for chamois at a wider scale. Therefore, we postulated that B. genuense invasion, enhanced by long-term grazing cessation, may reduce the availability of palatable plants for Apennine chamois, especially below the potential timberline (1900-2000 m a.s.l.). The high abundance of B. genuense may amplify the effect of other negative factors, such as competition with red deer (Cervus elaphus) and climate change, in restricting the suitable habitat of the Apennine chamois to the higher sectors of the central Apennines. Thus, we suggested that B. genuense spread should be monitored carefully and plans to control its invasion should be implemented.\n",

      "Results of investigations from many old landfills in Germany and Europe indicate that significant emissions occur under conventional landfill operating conditions (i.e., anaerobic conditions). Significant emissions via the gas phase are predicted to last at least three decades after landfill closure, while leachate emissions are predicted to continue for many decades, potentially even lasting for centuries [Heyer, K.-U., Stegmann, R., 1997. Langfristiges Gefahrdungspotenzial und Deponieverhalten von Ablagerungen; Bericht zum Teilvorhaben TV 4 im BMBF-Verbundvorhaben, \"Deponiekorper\"', Arbeitsbereich Abfallwirtschaft der TU Hamburg-Harburg, Projekttrager PTA-WAS (Umweltbundesamt Berlin); Krumpelbeck, I., 2000. Untersuchungen zum langfristigen Verhalten von Siedlungsabfall-deponien. Dissertation; Heft 3 der Veroffentlichungen der Bergischen Universitat - Gesamthochschule Wuppertal; Kjeldsen, P., Christophersen, M., 2001. Composition of leachate from old landfills in Denmark. Waste Management and Research, 200 1; 19(3):249-56]. When considering the specific type and quality, and quite often lack of, protection barriers associated with old landfills, these leachate and gas emissions may result in a significant negative impact on the environment. However, complete sealing of the landfill only temporarily reduces emissions because dry-conservation of the biodegradable waste fraction results, thus not allowing any severe reduction in the emission and hazardous potential of the landfill to occur. If noticeable damage of the surface capping system occurred in these landfills, infiltrating water would restart the interrupted emission formation.In contrast, aerobic in situ stabilization by means of low pressure aeration [AEROflott (R), Stegmann, R., Hupe, K., Heyer, K.-U., 2000. Verfahren zur abgestuften beschleunigten in situ-Stabilisierung von Deponien und Altablagerungen. Patent Nr. 10005243. Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt, Munchen] attempts to stabilize and modify the inventory of organic matter inside the landfill, acting to reduce the emission potential in a more sustainable manner. By enabling faster and more extensive aerobic degradation processes in the landfill (compared with anaerobic processes), the organics (e.g., hydrocarbons) are degraded significantly faster, resulting in an increased carbon discharge via the gas phase, as well as reduced leachate concentrations. Because carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main compound in the extracted off-gas (instead of methane (CH4), which dominated under anaerobic landfill conditions), the negative impact of diffuse LFG emissions towards an increased global warming effect may be significantly lowered. With respect to leachate quality, a reduction of organic compounds as well as ammonia-nitrogen can be expected. In addition to these positive ecological effects, aerobic in situ stabilization is associated with significant cost savings potential due to both quantitative and qualitative reductions in the aftercare period. This paper describes the fundamental processes and implications of in situ landfill aeration. Additionally, possible criteria for defining an endpoint of the active aeration process are presented and discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "High altitude environments are experiencing more rapid changes in temperature than the global average with the risk of losing essential ecosystem services in mountain environments. The Carpathians Mountains are regarded as hosting Europe's most pristine mountain ecosystems, yet the paucity of past environmental records limits our understanding of their sensitivity to the various drivers of change. A multi-proxy palaeoecological approach (plant macro-remains, pollen, charcoal) applied to three Holocene sediment sequences (between 1540 and 1810 m a.s.l.) in the Rodna Mountains documents past treeline and timberline shifts in response to climate change and human impact to anticipate the likely future responses. Our results indicate that forest reacted sensitively to past climate conditions. The timberline had exceeded an elevation of 1540 m a.s.l. by 10,200 cal. yr BP, when summers were warmer than today. The treeline remained below 1810 m a.s.l. at this time and reached its maximum elevation after 8500 cal. yr BP, when winter temperatures became milder. Cool summer conditions probably caused a lowering of the timberline and an extension of the treeline ecotone from 4900 cal. yr BP, a process accentuated by human impact from the Bronze Age (3500 cal. yr BP) onwards. The anticipated upslope tree movements as a consequence ongoing global warming are not yet clearly visible in our records, but will more probably take place in abandoned agricultural areas and be counter-balanced by re-enforced anthropogenic pressure elsewhere. Pinus sylvestris was the dominant tree species in the timberline under a warm and dry climate, when fires were frequent, during the early Holocene (11,250 10,200 cal. yr BP), while Picea abies became dominant in the timberline and Pinus mugo in the treeline ecotone, respectively from 10,200 cal. yr BP to the present. Abies alba became a significant component of the timber over the last four millennia. The anticipated future warmer and moister climatic conditions will favour the persistence of P. abies as well as A. alba. However, A. alba is more sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, which implies that in places with continuing farmland pressure, A. alba may be less prevalent than P. abies in the future. Anthropogenic pressure is expected to increase the proportion of tree species characteristic of more disturbed forests and consequently threaten biodiversity with important implications for mountain ecosystem services.

      "The first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Berlin established a pilot phase of so-called Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ). This pilot phase started in 1995 and was to end in 1999. It was prolonged at the fourth Conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires (1998) for a yet undetermined period after 2000. This paper is an empirical study of AIJ experience in the first five years (1995-1999) based on 96 AIJ from the UNFCCC's web site as of April 30, 1999, and a separate study on seven AIJ projects of Japan. The main results of this study are: (1) AIJ investment shows a pattern of regional-specificity with rather divergent regional investment portfolios in the United States, Japan and Europe. This, pattern can be traced back to differences in the national AIJ programs of investors and hosts, on the one hand, and to specific ways of minimizing transaction cost on the other, e.g. by attaching AIJ to established institutional links of development co-operation or by 'trading in the neighbourhood'; and (2) AIJs are overwhelmingly no regret-measures with almost zero or negative cost. Transaction costs of reporting have been minimized by applying simple and straightforward methods of baseline determination. The exception to this is the verification procedure where expensive external verification prevails. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Trees growing at the alpine timberline very seldom undergo severe water stress because of high precipitation during the vegetative period. Since trees are adapted to moist conditions, moderate water deficit may lead to a strong reduction in transpiration. Transpiration and xylem water potential were measured in two individuals each of Pinus cembra, Larix decidua and Picea abies growing at the timberline (2 080 m a.s.l.) in the north-eastern Italian Alps. From June to October 1996 predawn water potential was between -0.29 and -1.0 MPa with moderate differences among species. Throughout the growing period L. decidua showed a progressive decrease in the minimum water potential (from -0.45 to -1.93 MPa); in P. abies and P. cembra variations were more correlated to weather conditions with minima (-1.2 and -1.49 MPa, respectively) during a mild drought period. L. decidua showed the mean daily maximum sap flux density (about 3.3 dm(3) dm(-2) h(-1)) while mean maximum values in P. abies and P. cembra were about 0.9 and 0.7, respectively. High daily fluctuations of sap flow were observed in relation to rapid variations in weather conditions, particularly in L. decidua. Regardless of species a very high stomatal sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit was recorded. The three species seem to have evolved different drought avoidance strategies. L. decidua maintained a relatively high transpiration even during moderate water deficit periods because of its high water uptake capacity. During the same drought period P. abies and P. cembra showed an evident reduction in sap flux, suggesting a water saving behaviour. These different responses should be taken into account when considering the effects of global change on timberline trees. ((C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.).\n",

      "In this paper a multivariate linear regression model is proposed for predicting and mapping regional species richness in areas below the timberline according to environmental variables. The data used in setting up the model were derived from a floristic inventory. Using a stepwise regression technique, five environmental variables were found to explain 48.9% of the variability in the total number of plant species: namely temperature range, proximity to a big river or lake, threshold of minimum annual precipitation, amount of calcareous rock outcrops and number of soil types. A considerable part of the unexplained variability is thought to have been influenced by variations in the quality of the botanical inventory. These results show the importance of systematic floristic sampling in addition to conventional inventories when using floristic data as a basis in nature conservation. Nevertheless it is still possible to interpret the resulting diversity patterns ecologically. Regional species richness in Switzerland appears to be a function of: (i) environmental heterogeneity; (ii) threshold values of minimum precipitation; and (iii) presence of calcareous rock outcrops. According to similar studies, environmental heterogeneity was the strongest determinant of total species richness. In contrast to some studies, high productivity decreased the number of species. Furthermore, the implications of this work for climate change scenarios are discussed.\n",

      "Land cover is a critical factor that influences, and is influenced by, atmospheric chemistry and potential climate changes. As considerable uncertainty exists about the effects of differences in land cover on below-ground carbon (C) storage, we have compared soil C contents and turnover at adjacent, unmanaged, indigenous forest (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortiodes) and grassland (Chionochloa pallens) sites near the timberline in the same climo-edaphic environment in Craigieburn Forest Park, Canterbury, New Zealand.Total soil profile C was 13% higher in the grassland than in the forest (19.9 v. 16.7 kg/m(2)), and based on bomb C-14 measurements, the differences mainly resulted from more recalcitrant soil C in the grassland (5.3 v. 3.0 kg/m(2)). Estimated annual net primary production was about 0.4 kg C/m(2) for the forest and 0.5 kg C/m(2) for the grassland; estimated annual root production was about 0.2 and 0.4 kg C/m(2), respectively. In situ soil surface CO2-C production was similar in the grassland and the forest. The accumulation of recalcitrant soil C was unrelated to differences in mineral weathering or soil texture, but was apparently enhanced by greater soil water retention in the grassland ecosystem. Thus, contrary to model (ROTHC) predictions, this soil C fraction could be expected to respond to the effects of climate change on precipitation patterns.Overall, our results suggest that the different patterns of soil C accumulation in these ecosystems have resulted from differences in plant C inputs, soil aluminium, and soil physical characteristics, rather than from differences in soil mineral weathering or texture.\n",

      "Debates about climate justice have mainly occurred at the international scale, and have focussed on the rights and responsibilities of nation-states to either be protected from the effects of climate change, or to take action to reduce emissions or support adaptation. In this paper, we argue that it is both productive and necessary to examine how climate justice is being pursued at the urban scale, which brings into focus the need for attention to issues of recognition as well as rights and responsibilities. Building on work from environmental justice, which has conceptualized justice as trivalent, we propose that climate justice can be understood as a pyramid, the faces of which are distributions, procedures, rights, responsibilities and recognition. We then apply this conceptual framework to examine climate change interventions in five cities; Bangalore, Monterrey, Hong Kong, Philadelphia and Berlin. Arguing that the politics and practices of urban climate change interventions are constantly engaging with and refracting the idea of justice, we examine how justice was articulated, practiced and contested across our cases. The perspective of recognition emerges as a particularly useful entry point through which to explore the types of rights, responsibilities, distributions and procedures required to respond justly to climate change. We conclude by reflecting on our framework, arguing that it is useful both as an analytical device to interrogate climate justice and to shape the design of climate change interventions which seek to ensure climate justice.

      "In deciduous forests, soil moisture is an important driver of numerous physical, microbial, and biogeochemical processes. Therefore, characterizing the interactions between vegetation and soil moisture is critical to forecast long-term water resources and ecosystem health. However, these interactions are difficult to measure, both in time and space. Recent studies have shown the ability of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture at a range of scales. However, no study has yet attempted to use ERI to describe spatiotemporal variability of soil water in relation to vegetation structure and throughfall. In this study, at a mature forest site in Michigan, USA, we captured spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture using weekly ERI measurements augmented with throughfall and soil temperature measurements, and a detailed vegetation survey for five adjacent quadrats. Our results show that throughout the growing season, the soil moisture gradually declined despite strong variations in cumulative monthly rainfall. This decline was occasionally halted, but not reversed, during weeks with high precipitation. Spatial variability of electrical resistivity and soil moisture was not related to soil temperature differences but showed a strong correlation with canopy variables.

      "In polar ecosystems primary producers have to cope with the very limited living conditions of the harsh climate. Vascular plants in the Northern Hemisphere extend to the northern-most edges of the continents, but only two taxa are present as far south as the Antarctic Peninsula region in the Southern Hemisphere. Lower plants, lichens in particular, become more important with increasing latitudes and form the dominant element of the Antarctic vegetation. Based on recent investigations and literature, this paper discusses to what extent lichens are better adapted to snow and ice than vascular plants. Vascular plants in high latitudes have high freezing tolerances but are photosynthetically inactive in winter (e.g., evergreen coniferous species), while lichens in a highly freezing-tolerant stage can be active and productive under winter conditions. Vascular plants can be active under snow but have no photosynthesis if the tissue is frozen. Recent in situ measurements indicate that lichens are able to photosynthesize at temperatures below -10-degrees-C, apparently in the frozen state. It was also found that photosynthetic CO2 exchange of dry thalli can be activated by snow during frost. Water uptake during winter was also recorded for coniferous trees at the arctic timberline. This uptake may reduce water stress in conifers but apparently has no relevance for metabolic activity. Water uptake from snow and metabolic activity at -10-degrees-C are possible for lichens because they are able to photosynthesize at water potentials lower than -20 MPa. Although lichens are adapted to be active in snow at low temperatures, strong light on clear days may inhibit the photosynthetic apparatus.\n",

      "Approximately 300 volcanic ash and dust layers were observed in the Siple Dome (Antarctica) ice core. Most of this tephra, deposited between 700 and 800 m depth, consisted primarily of glass shards with varying amounts of crystalline material and groundmass fragments. The pattern of distribution of tephra fallout closely replicates that found in the Byrd ice core, indicative of contemporaneous deposition at both locations. Peak fallout occurred approximately 19 500 years ago, based on methane tie points in the Siple Dome and Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice cores. Mount Berlin was identified as a potential source of tephra, although other volcanoes in West and East Antarctica appear to have contributed ash and dust. Ice between 697 and 730 m, in which fine-grained tephra is concentrated, has undergone enhanced thinning compared to ice with a similar concentration of tephra deposited contemporaneously between 1300 and 1540m at Byrd. It is speculated that this thinning has occurred in response to dynamic interaction between ice at Siple Dome and the two ice streams flanking it. A dramatic change to a shear fabric appears to be directly related to the higher concentration of volcanic particles in the ice between 700 and 800 m.\n",

      "Dendroclimatic methods may quantify a factor or factors affecting delta C-13 fractionation and thus help to reveal the signals archived in dendroisotope records over the long term. Gathering evidence suggests a repertoire of limitations for photosynthesis to occur, with an increasing possibility that more than one external factor may control the assimilation rate and thus the tree-ring delta C-13 variations. Here we show that such a situation conceivably describes the tree-ring delta C-13 data from northern timberline and further illustrate the use of dendroclimatic analyses in separating the coexisting signals in dendroisotope data. While the assimilation rate was primarily controlled by a photon flux, thereby allowing the tree-ring delta C-13 to provide a proxy for past variations in irradiance, there was some evidence that also a temperature signal is directly present in the tree-ring delta C-13 data, not merely as a function of an indirect correlate reflecting its interplay between sunshine/cloud cover. Over the period common to all instrumental records (1971-2011), both the sunshine hours and global radiation influenced the delta C-13 from mid June to mid-July, whereas the mean maximum temperatures (T-MAX) showed an impact on delta C-13 from mid July to mid-August. We assume that these climatic associations represent mainly non-stomatal limitations to assimilation rate. Possibly, this response may involve the mesophyll conductance to CO2 transfer from intercellular spaces to chloroplasts, a factor found previously to pose a temperature responsive limitation to photosynthesis. After correction for the Suess effect, the delta C-13 chronology exhibited a long-term decline attributable to discrimination rate changes under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. We make a methodological contribution by comparing the various methods available from literature for estimating the magnitude of this bias in the delta C-13 chronology. The robustness of the results indicated that this data shortcoming is not critical but can be corrected. The method inter-comparisons yielded very similar results, near the previously suggested change in discrimination of 0.0073 parts per thousand per ppmv CO2. We recommend comparative assessments of discrimination rate change to be combined with dendroclimatic analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Climate change is one of the most important recent forces modulating the structure of ecological communities worldwide. Although a number of studies have documented climatically induced altitudinal range shifts, with species move upwards with increasing temperature and tracking their climatic optima, an examination of interspecific variability in such altitudinal shifts remains unexplored. Using a unique dataset on the altitudinal distribution of birds in a central European mountain range, collected with constant effort and methodology over more than 20 years, we examined the effects of particular species ecological traits on interspecific variability in altitudinal range shifts. We predicted that shifts would be greater in species with narrower European climatic niches, breeding in open habitats, feeding on insects and originally breeding at lower altitudes. Patterns of the shifts differed within the time period studied. In the first decade, no climate change was observed and species did not show any direction in their altitudinal shifts. In the second decade, local spring temperatures increased and species moved to higher altitudes. These altitudinal shifts were related to species habitat preferences, with open habitat species shifting to higher altitudes than forest species. The effect of other predictors was relatively small. The habitat effects imply either stronger self-regulation of the forest microclimate compared to open habitats, with forest species less forced to move upwards, or a delayed shift in the alpine timberline due to the slow growth of trees. In the latter case, forest species would face unfavourable climatic conditions and at the same time be constrained by the limited distribution of their habitat. Our study shows that species ecology can considerably alter the actual outcome of the impacts of ongoing climate change in mountain areas.\n",

Maps reflecting the distribution of different types of forest-tundra communities have been made, and data on the morphological and age structure of tree stands have been obtained for three time sections (the mid-1910s, 1960s, and 2000s). They show that open and closed forests have markedly expanded due to natural afforestation of the tundra and increase in the density and productivity of existing forest stands. The unidirectional pattern of plant community transition (from the tundra to closed forests) and meteorological data provide evidence that this transition has been conditioned by climate warming and increasing humidity recorded during the past 90 years.\n",

      "Our study at this natural analog site contributes to the evaluation of methods within a hierarchical monitoring concept suited for the control of CO2 degassing. It supports the development of an effective monitoring concept for geological CO2 storage sites-carbon capture and storage as one of the pillars of the European climate change efforts. This study presents results of comprehensive investigations along a 500-m long profile within the Hartousov (Czech Republic) natural CO2 degassing site and gives structural information about the subsurface and interaction processes in relation to parameters measured. Measurements of CO2 concentrations and investigation of the subsurface using electrical resistivity tomography and self-potential methods provide information about subsurface properties. For their successful application it is necessary to take seasonal variations (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, meteorological conditions) into consideration due to their influence on these parameters. Locations of high CO2 concentration in shallow depths are related to positive self-potential anomalies, low soil moistures and high resistivity distributions, as well as high delta 13C values and increased radon concentrations. CO2 ascends from deep geological sources via preferential pathways and accumulates in coarser sediments. Repetition of measurements (which includes the effects of seasonal variations) revealed similar trends and allows us to identify a clear, prominent zone of anomalous values. Coarser unconsolidated sedimentary layers are beneficial for the accumulation of CO2 gas. The distribution of such shallow geological structures needs to be considered as a significant environmental risk potential whenever sudden degassing of large gas volumes occurs.

      "Today, ground-based optical remote sensing (ORS) has become an intensively used method for quantifying pollutant or greenhouse gas emissions from point or area sources, and for the validation of airborne or satellite remote sensing data. In this study, we present the results of a release experiment using acetylene (C2H2) as a tracer gas, where three ORS techniques were simultaneously tested for two main purposes: (1) the detection of emission sources and (2) the quantification of release rates. Therefore, passive and active open-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (OP-FTIR) and open-path tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) were applied and evaluated. The concentration results of the active ORS methods are compared to those estimated by a Lagrangian stochastic atmospheric dispersion model. Our results reveal that passive OP-FTIR is a valuable tool for the rapid detection and imaging of emission sources and the spatial tracer gas distribution; while with active OP-FTIR and TDLAS, C2H2 concentrations in the sub-ppm range could be quantified that correlated well with the concentration data obtained by our modeling approach.

      "Prior to injecting CO2 at the Ketzin pilot site for carbon storage near Berlin, Germany, several pumping tests were conducted in the three wells drilled for CO2 injection and monitoring. To characterize subsurface properties and help interpret the behavior of CO2 injected in the subsequent experiments, we calibrate a groundwater flow model for numerically simulating the pumping tests. The model honors the vertical layering of the storage formation: a sandstone layer of 6-18 m thickness embedded in a thick low-permeability mudstone (about 70-80 m). Model calibration involves estimating the spatial distribution of permeability in 13 zones for the sandstone layer while keeping the permeability of the mudstone at a fixed low value (1 x 10(-15) m(2)). The calibrated model produces system responses that are in good agreement with the measured pressure drawdown data, suggesting that the essential flow processes occurring during the pumping tests are well captured. The estimated permeability distribution indicates that heterogeneity is significant and that the pilot site acts as a semi-closed hydrogeologic system with one side effectively blocked by a low-permeability region. Of the three wells analyzed (Ktzi 200, Ktzi 201, and Ktzi 202), the inversion algorithm finds permeable zones connecting Ktzi 202 with Ktzi 200/Ktzi 201, while a low-permeability zone is found between Ktzi 201 and Ktzi 200. The calibrated results are consistent with the core logging and crosshole baseline ERT data and can help explain the migration of the CO2 plume, inferred from 3-D seismic surveys and ERT data obtained during the subsequent CO2 injection experiment. A proof-of-concept model shows that the presence of a low permeability zone between Ktzi 200 and Ktzi 201 is in fact consistent with the monitored CO2 arrival times at both wells if this zone of low effective permeability contains a thin high-permeability layer allowing for fast transport. Presence of a thin layer of high-permeability sandstone within a thick low-permeability layer does not significantly affect the pressure response in a pumping test as the effective permeability is still low, but it has a much larger impact on the CO2 arrival time by providing a preferential path for the CO2 migration.

      "Shifts in climate regime have provoked substantial trophic- and species-dependent changes within ecosystems. With growing concerns of present global warming, we examined potential lake ecosystem responses, natural hierarchy responses (i.e. immediate responses at lower system levels as opposed to delayed responses at higher system levels), and possible shifts among abiotic (physics, nutrients) and biotic (phytoplankton, zooplankton) system components. Specifically, we analyzed decadal data collected from Muggelsee, a lake in Berlin, Germany, for climate-induced abiotic and biotic changes, their timing and type, and classified them as abrupt permanent, gradual permanent, abrupt temporary, or monotonic. We further categorized variable changes as a function of system hierarchy, including lake physics (ice, temperature, stratification), nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, silicate), plankton, and levels of integration (i.e. species, taxonomic groups, and total plankton). Contrary to current theory, data suggest abrupt responses did not occur in a hierarchy-dependent manner, nor was a clear pattern observed among functional system-based categories. Abrupt permanent changes were the most prominent response pattern observed, suggesting they may be driven by large-scale climatic oscillations and by surpassed thresholds, as noted in previous case studies. Gradual changes coincided with affected abiotic parameters spanning an expansive time range; for example, climatic effects in spring preceded changes in nutrient limitation. Variables displaying no long-term changes pointed to compensation processes caused by, e.g., simultaneously acting forces of warming trends and climate-independent changes in trophic state. Nevertheless, the complexity of response patterns at the single system level manifested clear chronological regime shifts in abiotic and biotic parameters in spring and, to a lesser extent, in summer. With regard to projected global warming, the majority of currently unaffected system levels may face impending thermal thresholds, achievement of which would result in an accelerated shift in ecosystem state.\n",

This paper summarises the main anthropogenic influences on the water cycle in a Pleistocene landscape and associated geochemical reactions. The results allow the identification and description of the main hydraulic and geochemical processes that control water and solute fluxes in different hydrological compartments, in particular recharge and discharge regions. Under progressive climate change, this process-based knowledge should be used to adapt land and water management to minimise negative impacts on hydrological resources and stabilise the regional water balance in the Berlin-Brandenburg Pleistocene landscape.

      "The role of carbon balance, and particularly carbon sinks, to forest boundaries and climate responses is a major question in forest ecophysiology. At timberline, low-temperature limitations on carbon-sink processes of stem and especially root tissue have been implicated in hypotheses of the upper range limits to tree distributions. Studies on carbon sinks in root and stem tissue of trees at timberline typically report variation in only one carbon sink, such as either growth, respiration, or non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs). However, these carbon sinks may differ in their response to elevation. We asked how three carbon-sink processes in root and stem tissue (i.e. all tissue below the crown of needles) change in conifer seedlings growing from the lower (2450 m) to the upper (3000 m) edges of the timberline ecotone throughout their first growth season. We repeatedly measured respiration (mg(-1) and individual(-1)), growth (relative growth rates [RGR] and biomass), and NSCs in root and stem tissue of Abies lasiocarpa and Pseudotsuga menziesii.RGR of root and stem tissue were less at the upper compared to lower elevation, but only for the first few weeks of the growing season. Total biomass of root and stem tissue was generally less at the upper site, apparently due to low early season RGR, but ultimately did not significantly differ between sites by the end of the growing season. Unlike growth, respiration rates (mg(-1)) did not differ between elevations during any period of the growing season. Nevertheless, total respiration of CO2 from root and stem tissue (individual(-1)) was 22% less at the upper site, which was attributable to less biomass. NSCs of root and stem tissue, specifically starch, were overall greater at the upper site, particularly for A. lasiocarpa at the end of the season, which did not parallel spatiotemporal trends in growth or respiration. The differences in seasonal trends and the effects of elevation on carbon sinks indicate a degree of independence or uncoupling of growth, respiration, and NSCs of root and stem tissue, which is not commonly appreciated in hypotheses about physiological limitations for trees at timberline.

      "The Tibetan Plateau holds some of the world's highest undisturbed natural treelines and timberlines. Such extreme environments constitute potentially valuable monitoring sites of the effects of climate warming on high-elevation forests. Here, we analyze a network of 21 Smith fir forests situated in the Sygera Mountains, southeastern Tibetan Plateau, using tree-ring width (TRW) and basal area increment (BAI) chronologies. Sampled sites encompassed a wide elevation gradient, from 3600 to 4400 m, including some treeline sites and diverse aspects and tree ages. In comparison with TRW series, BAI series better capture the long-term warming signal. Previous November and current April and summer temperatures are the dominant climatic factors controlling Smith fir radial growth. The mean inter-series correlations of TRW increased upwards, but the forest limit presented the highest potential to reconstruct past temperature variability. Moreover, the growth responses of young trees were less stable than those of trees older than 100 years. Climate warming is accelerating radial growth of Smith fir forest subjected to mesic conditions. Collectively, these findings confirm that the effects of site elevation and tree age should be considered when quantifying climate-growth relationships. The type of tree-ring data (BAI vs. TRW) is also relevant since BAI indices seem to be a better climatic proxy of low-frequency temperature signals than TRW indices. Therefore, site (e.g., elevation) and tree (e.g., age) features should be considered to properly evaluate the effects of climate warming on growth of high-elevation forests.\n",

      "Radiocarbon dates from prehistoric campsites and game-drive systems were used to develop a 3000-yr chronology of human population change at high altitude in the Colorado Front Range. Populations increased to record levels during the Late Prehistoric Period and then declined, tracking a probable warming-and-cooling trend. Superimposed on the long-term cycle were short-term oscillations that correlate closely with episodes of lichen snowkill inferred from the diameters of Rhizocarpon subgenus Rhizocarpon thalli in randomly selected 100-m(2) sample plots above tree limit. Transplant experiments and historical accounts of an epic storm in the spring of 1844 help understand the causes of lichen snowkill and its linkage to hunter-gatherers. During five periods of unknown duration between 1000 BC and AD 1230, vast areas above timberline remained snow covered for an average of at least 40 wk yr(-1). Upslope snowstorms triggered by low temperatures and by cut-off low pressure systems in the southwestern United States are thought to have been responsible. The snow caused elk (Cervus elaphus), bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to starve on their springtime ranges in the eastern Front Range foothills. It damaged important forage species above timberline, discouraging surviving game animals and their human predators from returning to high altitudes for many decades. Springtime snow became less important after AD 1230, when northwesterly airflow intensified and lichen mortality was restricted to the floors of expanded snowpatches in topographic catchments. Low temperatures, summer drought, and epidemic disease were characteristic of this part of the archaeological record. The study demonstrates that changes in the frequency of archaeological radiocarbon dates in extreme environments can provide useful proxy evidence for climatic change and a precise chronological framework in which to interpret discontinuous paleoenvironmental data. It cautions that the East Slope of the Front Range is vulnerable to upslope snowstorms larger and more frequent than any that have occurred since the beginning of meteorological observations in the region.\n",

      "A model simulation of the climate during Maunder Minimum (MM) (1645-1715) was performed using the Freie Universitat Berlin Climate Middle Atmosphere Model (FUB-CMAM). A multi-year equilibrium integration with prescribed solar insolation, atmospheric composition and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for MM conditions was compared with a present-day (PD) simulation. We find that during MM the stratosphere was significantly warmer (up to 3 K) than during PD, and dynamically more disturbed in winter. The warming is due to the dominant effect of be lower atmospheric CO(2) concentration during MM which leads to a reduced emission of long-wave radiation. and compensates the cooling due to the reduced solar irradiance. The troposphere was about 1-1.5 K cooler in the annual mean during MM. The global mean surface air temperature decreased by 0.86 K. Northern hemisphere winters were on average characterized by cooler and drier weather over the northern parts of the continents. with an increase in precipitation in the southern parts. These climate anomalies are shown to be related to a shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) towards a predominantly low phase during MM. The simulated climate anomalies are in very good agreement with reconstructions from proxy-data. Changes in the dynamical coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere were found in the MM simulation, indicating the importance of the stratosphere for climate change. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we developed 595-year tree ring-width chronology from Larix speciosa near the timberlines of the Gaoligong Mountains, southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Ring-width site chronologies and a well-replicated regional chronology (RC) showed significant positive correlations with warm season temperatures from May to August. Using RC as predictor, we reconstructed mean May-August temperature for the study region that extends back to A.D. 1585. Cold conditions prevailed during the periods 1600s, 1620-30, 1640-50s, 1700s, 1730-405,1760s, 1810-20s, 1850s, 1900-10s and 1955-70. Warm episodes occurred during 1610s, 1660-1680s, 1710-20s, 1750s, 1780-90s, 1820-40,1920-50 and 1980-present. Spatial correlations with gridded land surface temperatures revealed that our reconstruction represents regional temperature signal for the southern Tibetan Plateau. Comparison with other tree ring-based temperature reconstructions from surrounding areas implies a high degree of confidence for our reconstruction.

      "In the 20th century, woody species expanded on many mountain ridges as grazing and mowing of subalpine grasslands was abandoned. As a result, subalpine meadows started disappearing, affecting entire montane ecosystems. To predict the consequences of changes in land use it is important to identify the ecological mechanisms behind changes in vegetation. This study examined the temporal and spatial variability of woody species succession on abandoned subalpine meadows in the Western Bieszczady Mts. (Eastern Carpathian Biosphere Reserve). We analysed the spatial patterns of Sorbus aucuparia recruitment in relation to topography and temporal changes in weather conditions, and found that the recruitment rate was not continuous. Two phases of rowan expansion were distinguished. In the first (before the 1970s), expansion depended on topography: northern and steep slopes were colonised and the development of thickets progressed from lower to higher elevations. In the second phase, starting in the 1970s, rowans crossed the historical timberline and on both northern and southern slopes was unrelated to topographical conditions. Moreover, in the last 60 years, during which meteorological data were recorded, the rate of rowan expansion has been negatively correlated with precipitation and snow cover thickness. The temporal and spatial patterns of rowan recruitment on abandoned subalpine meadows indicate that land use changes were important in initiating the first stage of succession. Contrary to the common view and our own expectation that mildening of weather conditions facilitates colonisation of montane areas by trees, our results suggest that rowan expansion was positively associated with worsening of weather conditions (i.e. thinner snow cover and lower temperatures).

      "Fluctuations of the altitudinal position and composition of the timberline in northern Sweden have occurred in response to climatic changes following deglaciation (c. 8800 yrs BP). In this study a soil sequence of predominantly Podzols (Spodosols) was analysed to determine if the soil profiles located above the present timberline were actively forming in the low-alpine environment, or whether they represent relict features of a once stronger pedogenic regime. The results of the soil analysis indicate a relatively uniform parent material with increasing fines near the surface reflecting aeolian influxed sediment. The soil profiles located above the timberline are generally characterized by darker colours, although with a lower accumulation of organic carbon and either similar or higher iron and aluminium in the spodic horizon than are found in the profiles located below the timberline. The alpine Podzols, generally located in protected swales, are quite distinct from Brunisols (Inceptisols) and Regosols (Entisols) found in slopes and swells on the predominantly undulating morainic and glaciofluvial landscape. This appears to indicate that Spodosols located above the present timberline are not actively being modified under the present low-alpine environmental conditions, but rather were initiated during the Atlantic Chronozone when a dwarf or stunted forest extended to approximately 900 m above sea level.\n",

      "This study reports the main features of quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) period variability at stratospheric levels from 70 to 10 hPa and its attribution from the duration variability of westerly and easterly phases using monthly mean zonal wind data from August 1956 to July 2013, archived by Free University of Berlin. A total of 24 QBO events have been distinguished based on the zonal wind field and wavelet analysis for it. The QBO period varies in phase at various stratospheric levels and shows no significant long-term trend but decadal to multi-decadal variability. The noted case-to-case variations in QBO period are due to variations in durations of the westerly and easterly phases at the same level. The highly coupled variability of the easterly duration in the upper levels above 30 hPa and westerly durations in the lower levels below, which manifests the stalling or accelerating of the descent rate of easterly wind regimes around 30 hPa, is found to be the dominant variability of the easterly and westerly durations at various stratospheric levels. Accordingly, the period of QBO in the lower levels below 40 hPa/upper levels above 20 hPa is determined by the westerly/easterly durations there in about 75 % of the 24 QBO events; and at 30 hPa, variations in the durations of both easterly and westerly phases contribute to the QBO period variability. On the contrary, in only 4 out of 24 QBO events, the variations of the westerly/easterly durations in the upper/lower levels are greater than the variations of the easterly/westerly durations in the upper/lower levels, making deterministic contributions to the QBO period variability.\n",

      "Timberline and environmental change: The importance of scale and space for the study of high altitude ecosystems. The usefulness of the upper timberline as an indicator of climate change is reviewed in the light of the results of a study of subalpine post-pastoral succession in the Maurienne Valley (Savoie, France). The authors propose a hierarchical and systemic approach to take into account the complexity and heterogeneity of the timberline. The latter is considered as a mosaic ecotone whose evolution may be studied (1) by considering a mean line when observing the mosaic from far away, (2) by considering the boundaries between the physionomical and geomorphological units of the mosaic and (3) by focusing on the individual forest borders. The dynamic potentialities of the forest borders mainly depend on their place in the phyto-morphological mosaic. Thus geomorphology is an important feature determining the landscape patterns and the recolonization patterns. The use of the timberline as an indicator of climate change is subjected to two conditions. Firstly, the climate parameters must be considered on a number of scales, according to the scales on which the vegetation dynamics itself may be studied. Secondly, the influence of the geomorphological parameters must not be neglected.\n",

      "A newly developed daytime cloud property retrieval algorithm, FAME-C (Freie Universitat Berlin AATSR MERIS Cloud), is presented. Synergistic observations from the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), both mounted on the polar-orbiting Environmental Satellite (Envisat), are used for cloud screening. For cloudy pixels two main steps are carried out in a sequential form. First, a cloud optical and microphysical property retrieval is performed using an AATSR near-infrared and visible channel. Cloud phase, cloud optical thickness, and effective radius are retrieved, and subsequently cloud water path is computed. Second, two cloud top height products are retrieved based on independent techniques. For cloud top temperature, measurements in the AATSR infrared channels are used, while for cloud top pressure, measurements in the MERIS oxygen-A absorption channel are used. Results from the cloud optical and microphysical property retrieval serve as input for the two cloud top height retrievals. Introduced here are the AATSR and MERIS forward models and auxiliary data needed in FAME-C. Also, the optimal estimation method, which provides uncertainty estimates of the retrieved property on a pixel basis, is presented. Within the frame of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project, the first global cloud property retrievals have been conducted for the years 2007-2009. For this time period, verification efforts are presented, comparing, for four selected regions around the globe, FAME-C cloud optical and microphysical properties to cloud optical and microphysical properties derived from measurements of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite. The results show a reasonable agreement between the cloud optical and microphysical property retrievals. Biases are generally smallest for marine stratocumulus clouds: -0.28, 0.41 mu m and 0.18 gm(-2) for cloud optical thickness, effective radius and cloud water path, respectively. This is also true for the root-mean-square deviation. Furthermore, both cloud top height products are compared to cloud top heights derived from ground-based cloud radars located at several Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites. FAME-C mostly shows an underestimation of cloud top heights when compared to radar observations. The lowest bias of -0.3 km is found for AATSR cloud top heights for single-layer clouds, while the highest bias of -3.0 km is found for AATSR cloud top heights for multilayer clouds. Variability is low for MERIS cloud top heights for low-level clouds, and high for MERIS cloud top heights for mid-level and high-level single-layer clouds, as well as for both AATSR and MERIS cloud top heights for multilayer clouds.\n",

      "Despite several studies on the timberline dynamics in Europe were carried out in the last decades, very few papers refer to mountain areas where the timberline is composed of broadleaved trees, and no research was conducted on the dynamics of Apennine beech timberline in relation to seedling survival. The research aim was to analyse the beech wood timberline dynamics in the central Apennines, with reference to seedling survival. Furthermore, factors affecting seedling survival were identified. To assess the forest ecotone dynamics, vegetation layer cover, rock fragment cover and information about forest management and krummholz occurrence were collected in sampling plots placed over 1,600 m a.s.l., on north-facing slopes. The beech seedlings occurring in Brachypodium genuense-dominated stands above the timberline were counted and monitored along two growing seasons. Soil temperature, soil moisture, and photosynthetically active radiation available for seedlings (PHAR) in grasslands above timberline were measured. The research outputs indicate that timberline is not a natural boundary and that there is no evidence of its extension upwards. The greatest number of beech seedlings was recorded in late spring. The one-year mortality rate ranged from 71 to 100%. None of the seedlings still alive in the early autumn of the first year were recorded in the following spring. The competitive exclusion by Brachypodium genuense individuals, which limit the incident PHAR, and the low soil moisture during summer, were identified as the main factors that account for the high mortality of seedlings and affect beech regeneration above timberline. The effect of competition is probably intensified by the lack of pioneer shrubs which could otherwise serve as nurse plants for beech seedlings and protect them from browsing by wild ungulates. Thus, both the current and the past land use may be considered as driving forces in timberline dynamics.Probably, also the trend of global warming, that in the Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean climatic context would determine the increase of summer drought stress, could worsen the effect of competitive exclusion of beech seedlings, so that it can be hypothesized that the expansion upwards of the upper timberline in the Apennines could be totally blocked.\n",

      "We focused on the mediating role of slope aspect and spatial pattern on upper treeline ecotonal dynamics at multiple spatial scales in the Southern Rocky Mountains to infer process interactions and gauge the importance of feedbacks in determining the potential response of upper treeline to climate change on contrasting south- and north-facing slopes. Dendroecological techniques were used to reconstruct tree establishment within the upper treeline ecotone and Ripley's K was used for spatial pattern analysis. Tree age was determined by using age to coring-height corrections, and the influence of slope aspect was quantitatively assessed at multiple spatial scales using Mann-Whitney U-Tests. Widespread tree establishment occurred within the treeline ecotone on both south- and north-facing slopes during the 20th century, but tree ages above timberline are significantly younger on north-facing slopes at all spatial scales (local, landscape, and regional). The spatial pattern of tree establishment above timberline was predominantly random, except for significant clustering on south-lacing slopes in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The aspect mediation of tree age and spatial pattern suggest that the importance of feedbacks may vary according to slope aspect and that both of these environmental factors should be considered when assessing possible treeline response to climate change.\n",

      "The late Quaternary diatom record from subalpine Crowfoot Lake, Banff National Park, Alberta (lat. 51 degrees 61'N; long. 116 degrees 31'W) has been analyzed. Results are related to independently inferred vegetation and climate changes. No diatoms were found in the basal diamict that predates 11 330 C-14 yr BP. Very few occur until ca. 10 100 C-14 yr BP probably due to the short time between de-glaciation and an advance of the Crowfoot Glacier during the 'Younger Dryas Chron'. Initial pioneering species were characteristic of alkaline water and calcareous organic sediments. They appeared as sediments became organic and laminated suggesting increasing water clarity, and as the Pinus-dominated forest expanded and the climate warmed. After ca. 9060 C-14 yr BP diatom numbers increased rapidly, reaching a maximum prior to the Mazama tephra; they remained high until ca. 3500 C-14 Yr BP. The period between ca. 9060 and 3500 C-14 yr saw timberline elevation increase and the dominance of xerophytic taxa. These are consistent with early to mid-Holocene warmth and aridity. Diatom productivity reflects the warm climate and presumably longer ice-free season, a stable catchment and transparent water. Decreases in diatom productivity coincide with a vegetation change with reduction of xerophytic taxa and the appearance of a closed Picea-Abies forest, hence a cooler, wetter climate at ca. 4100 to 3500 C-14 yr BP The diatom numbers during the Neoglacial were of the same magnitude as prior to ca. 9060 C-14 yr BP. Small species of Fragilaria (overwhelmingly Fragilaria construens v. venter) became extremely dominant during the period of high diatom productivity, and remained so thereafter. Recovery of the lake appears to have been rapid after deposition of the Mazama tephra. Maximum occurrence of Cyclotella radiosa occurred ca. 8000 C-14 Yr BP during the warm early Holocene and may reflect this warmer climate, a longer ice-free season than presently, perhaps less turbid water, or it may reflect a subtly higher nutrient status of the lake water. The diatom record of Crowfoot Lake has responded with sensitivity, particularly in terms of productivity, to the Holocene vegetation and climate changes.\n",

      "The vulnerability of forest ecosystem services to climate change is expected to depend on landscape characteristic and management history, but may also be influenced by the proximity to the southern range limit of constituent tree species. In the Western Rhodopes in South Bulgaria, Norway spruce is an important commercial species, but is approaching its current southern limit. Using climate sensitive forest models, we projected the impact of climate change on timber production, carbon storage, biodiversity and soil retention in two representative landscapes in the Western Rhodopes; a lower elevation landscape (1000–1450 m a.s.l) dominated by mixed species forests, and a higher elevation landscape (1550–2100 m a.s.l.) currently dominated by spruce. In both landscapes climate change is projected to induce a shift in forest composition, with drought-sensitive species, such as Norway spruce, being replaced by more drought-tolerant species such as Scots pine and black pine at lower elevations. In the higher elevation landscape a reduction in spruce growth is projected, particularly under the more severe climate change scenarios. Under most climate scenarios a reduction in growing stock is projected to occur, but under some scenarios a moderate increase in higher elevation stands (>1500 m a.s.l.) is expected. Climate change is projected to negatively influence carbon storage potential across landscapes with the magnitude depending on the severity of the climate change scenario. The impact of climate change on forest diversity and habitat availability is projected to differ considerably between the two landscapes, with diversity and habitat quality generally increasing at higher elevations, and being reduced at lower elevations. Our results suggest that if currently management practices are maintained the sensitivity of forests and forest ecosystem services in the Western Rhodopes to climate change will differ between low and higher elevation sites and will depend strongly on current forest composition. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Palaeoecological studies in the \"Alpe d'Essertse\" area have provided much information about vegetation changes and timberline fluctuations during the Holocene. In this study we repeated previous biostratigraphic investigations using plant macrofossils to improve their temporal and taxonomic resolution and to test their reliability. By analyzing 0.5-cm layers of a lake sediment we reached a temporal resolution of 44 years, and we were able to reconstruct vegetation changes in the surrounding area at species level. The sedimentary record analyzed extends from the Late-Glacial to the late Holocene. Alpine grasslands (12'000-11'000 cal. BP) were afforested by Larix decidua, Juniperus nana, and Pinus cembra (11,000-9'600 cal. B.P.). Stable subalpine larch-stone pine-forests (9'600-4'900 cal. BP) were followed by shrublands and meadows as a consequence of the climatically and anthropogenically induced destruction of forest vegetation (4'900-2'600 cal. BP). Changes in the abundance of P cembra and L. decidua needles as well as changes of the other taxa were consistent with those found in previous studies from the same lake. Our results demonstrate that plant-macrofossil records can be reproduced spatially and temporally on separate cores with independent C-14 chronologies.\n",

      "The contribution of agro-ecosystems to carbon sequestration in the form of soil organic matter (SOM) is increasingly considered as a mitigating factor for climate change. The ecosystem carbon storage depends on the balance between C inputs and outflows due to SOM breakdown. SOM decomposition has been reported as mostly affected by temperature and water availability, at global and regional scale, and by C quality at local scale, where climate can be considered relatively uniform. In this work, a new model of SOM decomposition is presented. The SOMDY model is based on an advanced description of SOM chemical quality by 13C-CPMAS NMR instead of traditional C/N ratio. The model includes also the effects of physical aggregation of organic matter. SOMDY was calibrated on CO2 emission data from extensive field experimental measurements. The simulation results showed the model capability to predict SOM changes during decomposition processes, including the effects of addition of organic amendments (e.g., compost applications, crop residual burial), as well as the impact of different tillage practices on the physical structure of soil aggregation. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

      "We calculated stem CO2 efflux (E (S)) of Pinus canariensis at a timberline site in Tenerife, Canary Islands, from March 7, 2008 and February 9, 2009. E (S) varied markedly throughout the year. Although E (S) generally followed the seasonal trends in temperature, we observed seasonal adjustment of E (S) in both E (S) normalized to temperature (E (S10)) and the temperature sensitivity (Q (10)) resulting in lower E (S10) values during the warm and dry season as compared during the cold and wet season; the latter corresponding with the period of stem growth. The Q (10) by contrast, was higher during the warm and dry summer than during the cold and wet season, an observation suggesting that climate extremes such as summer drought in the Mediterranean may override the observation that Q (10) declines with increasing temperature. As concurrent measurements estimating the potential impact of sap flow on E (S) revealed no interaction in P. canariensis, the Q (10) values were used along with E (S10) and stem temperature records to predict annual total E (S) and for partitioning total E (S) into its maintenance (E (m)) and a growth (E (g)) component.\n",

The collection of 64 samples from the southern boreal forest zone was dendrochronologically cross-dated to A.D. 673-1788. Growth characteristics were determined by performing density profiles including the following parameters: minimum density, earlywood and latewood boundary density, maximum density, earlywood width, earlywood density, latewood width, latewood density, annual ring width and annual ring density. Seven out of the nine parameters were found to contain non-climatic growth trends and six were found to be heteroscedastic in their variance. Tree-specific records were indexed, to remove the non-climatic growth trends and stabilize the variance, and combined into nine parameter-specific tree-ring chronologies. Growth characteristics of the pines changed in parallel with the generally agreed climatic cooling from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age: pine tree-rings showed decreasing maximum densities from the period A.D. 975-1150 to A.D. 1450-1625. A concomitant change in the intra-annual growth characteristics was detected between these periods. The findings indicate that not only the trees growing near the species' distributional limits are sensitive to large-scale climatic variations but also the trees growing in habitats remote from the timberline have noticeably responded to past climate changes.\n",

      "Decadal growth variability of Norway spruce increases with elevation. Recent temperature sensitivity and growth enhancement are limited to trees growing in the zone adjacent to timberline.Growth trends and climate responses of forest trees along elevational gradients are not fully understood. A deeper insight is, however, fundamental for predicting ecosystem functioning and productivity under future climate change. Supplementary to the effects of elevation and regional provenance on tree growth are sample depth, uneven representation of sample age and varying site conditions. Furthermore, there is only a limited number of studies addressing growth changes along elevational gradients, while at the same time applying tree-ring standardization methods that are sensitive to trend preservation. Here, we introduce 12 novel tree-ring width chronologies of Norway spruce (Picea abies[L.] Karst.) from four elevational belts encompassing montane forests and the local timberline in three regions in East-Central Europe between 15A degrees and 19A degrees E. Each chronology is characterized by sufficient sample replication and a comparable age structure between 1906 and 2010. Tree growth near timberline revealed substantial medium-frequency variability and sharply increasing ring widths since the 1980s. Medium-frequency growth variability of lower elevation trees was, however, relatively small, and growth rates over the last decade were either stable or even decreased. During the last four decades, Norway spruce from higher elevations exhibited a reduced response to autumn temperatures preceding ring formation. In contrast, trees from the lower-montane zone increased their sensitivity to drought during the same time. Our results emphasize not only different but also instable growth trends and climate responses of forest trees along altitudinal gradients, which should be considered in future forest management strategies.\n",

      "Despite of the importance of temperature in the fluvial ecosystems, the knowledge of its spatial and temporal variability in Andean rivers is limited, thus it is necessary to clarify the relative importance of site-specific factors in controlling the temperature of rivers. The aim of this research was to characterize the thermal regime of five Andean streams through an altitudinal gradient. The results show that there is a spatial and temporal variability in water temperature with a relatively rapid rise in temperature in mid-December, being stable in January and February, and a rapid decrease at the beginning of March and April. The thermal heterogeneity recorded in the high Andean zone of the Biobio River Basin makes it clear that geomorphology characteristics of each site are important in regulating water, temperature, associated mainly with the altitude and shade; this latter mainly generated by high mountains and in some cases by the timberline. It is known that thermal variability, mainly the maximum and minimum mean temperatures; causing severe stress on stenotherm organisms. Therefore, a deeper knowledge of the river temperature is essential for the management and future protection of the Andean freshwater ecosystems to mitigate the impacts associated to the global warming.\n",

      "The forest timberline responds quickly and markedly to climate changes, rendering it a ready indicator. Climate warming has caused an upshift of the timberline worldwide. However, the impact on belowground ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles remain elusive. To understand soil microbial ecology of the timberline, we analyzed microbial communities via 16s rRNA Illumina sequencing, a microarray-based tool named GeoChip 4.0 and a random matrix theory-based association network approach. We selected 24 sampling sites at two vegetation belts forming the timberline of Shennongjia Mountain in Hubei Province of China, a region with extraordinarily rich biodiversity. We found that temperature, among all of measured environmental parameters, showed the most significant and extensive linkages with microbial biomass, microbial diversity and composition at both taxonomic and functional gene levels, and microbial association network. Therefore, temperature was the best predictor for microbial community variations in the timberline. Furthermore, abundances of nitrogen cycle and phosphorus cycle genes were concomitant with NH4+-N, NO3--N and total phosphorus, offering tangible clues to the underlying mechanisms of soil biogeochemical cycles. As the first glimpse at both taxonomic and functional compositions of soil microbial community of the timberline, our findings have major implications for predicting consequences of future timberline upshift.\n",

The objective of this study was to assess the total ecosystem carbon stock in a Polylepis incana woodland, i.e., aboveground biomass (canopy trees and understory), root biomass and soil carbon stocks were all quantified. As part of this study, an allometric equation for the quantification of the aboveground biomass of individual P. incana trees was developed for the first time. The most important carbon pool was the soil (39.7 +/- A 6.9 kg m(-2)) followed by the aboveground biomass of Polylepis trees (3.8 +/- A 0.7 kg m(-2)). The total ecosystem carbon stock was estimated to be 43.9 +/- A 7.6 kg m(-2); thus, 90.6 % of the ecosystem carbon stock is soil carbon.\n",

      "Xylem embolism is a limiting factor for woody species worldwide. Conifers at the alpine timberline are exposed to drought and freeze-thaw stress during winter, which induce potentially lethal embolism. Previous studies indicated that timberline trees survive by xylem refilling. In this study on Picea abies, refilling was monitored during winter and spring seasons and analyzed in the laboratory and in situ experiments, based on hydraulic, anatomical, and histochemical methods. Refilling started in late winter, when the soil was frozen and soil water not available for the trees. Xylem embolism caused up to 86.2% +/- 3.1% loss of conductivity and was correlated with the ratio of closed pits. Refilling of xylem as well as recovery in shoot conductance started in February and corresponded with starch accumulation in secondary phloem and in the mesophyll of needles, where we also observed increasing aquaporin densities in the phloem and endodermis. This indicates that active, cellular processes play a role for refilling even under winter conditions. As demonstrated by our experiments, water for refilling was thereby taken up via the branches, likely by foliar water uptake. Our results suggest that refilling is based on water shifts to embolized tracheids via intact xylem, phloem, and parenchyma, whereby aquaporins reduce resistances along the symplastic pathway and aspirated pits facilitate isolation of refilling tracheids. Refilling must be taken into account as a key process in plant hydraulics and in estimating future effects of climate change on forests and alpine tree ecosystems.\n",

      "Long-term ecological research has become a cornerstone of the scientific endeavour to better understand ecosystem responses to environmental change. This paper provides a perspective on how such research could be advanced. It emphasizes that a profound understanding of the mechanisms underlying these responses requires that records of ecologic processes be not only sufficiently long, but also collected at an appropriate temporal resolution. We base our argument on an overview of studies of climate impacts in limnic and marine ecosystems, suggesting that lakes and oceans respond to (short-term) weather conditions during critical time windows in the year. The observed response patterns are often time-lagged or driven by the crossing of thresholds in weather-related variables (such as water temperature and thermal stratification intensity). It becomes clear from the previous studies that average annual, seasonal or monthly climate data often fall short of characterizing the thermal dynamics that most organisms respond to. To illustrate such literature-based evidence using a concrete example, we compare 2 years of water temperature data from Muggelsee (Berlin, Germany) at multiple temporal scales (from hours to years). This comparison underlines the pitfalls of analysing data at resolutions not high enough to detect critical differences in environmental forcing. Current science initiatives that aim at improving the temporal resolution of long-term observatory data in aquatic systems will help to identify adequate timescales of analysis necessary for the understanding of ecosystem responses to climate change.\n",

      "The share of renewable resources in electricity generation, e.g. in Germany, is increasing. The power sector is thus becoming more dependent on climate/weather parameters. During the summer months of the last decade, numerous thermal power plants in Europe had to be throttled due to water shortages and high water temperatures. At the same time, Europe was confronted with a reduction in hydropower production. One method of securing a future electricity supply is to increase the reliability of the water supply for power plants. In this paper, scenarios are presented for future electricity production by hydropower and thermal power plants in the Elbe river basin. Electricity production in hydropower plants will decline by approximately 13 % by 2050. This decline is due to climate change and it could be compensated for by optimizing and modernizing existing hydropower plants. Due to higher efficiencies and the conversion of plant cooling systems, no water shortages are expected in most thermal power plants. However, water shortages are expected to affect the plants in the city of Berlin. Inter- and intra-basin water transfers constitute a possible adaptation option. While the transfer of water from the river Oder would be the most cost-efficient solution from Berlin's perspective, the transfer of water from the river Elbe would have additional positive effects in the upstream Spree river sub-basin.\n",

It comes back to the recent history of the Conference of the Parties and shows the reasons for the emergence of the notion of 'equitable rights to sustainable development (EASD)' which enlarged the concept of equity beyond 'burden sharing'. It shows why this paradigm shift is a categorical imperative to break the self-defeating process of negotiations since the first COP of Berlin in 1995. It then demonstrate how the contributions to this special issue a) help understanding the deadlocks of a 'sharing the pie' logic in the climate affair and why it is inappropriate and diversionary to assess climate justice through 'fairness' of emissions allocations as the sole criteria b) show how to enforce the EADS principle in the current adverse context of a world economy weakened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n",

      "In the glacially formed landscape of north-eastern Germany pronounced hydrological changes have been detected in recent decades, leading to the general question how lake levels and related groundwater levels perform in a long-term perspective, i.e. during the last c. 100 years. But long-term lake-level records are rare; most observations do not start before the late 20th century. Therefore, the potential of historic hydrological data, comprising drowned trees (as a geo-/bioarchive) and aerial as well as map imagery (as a document archive) was tested in order to derive discrete-time lake-level stands. These data are contrasted with lake-level simulations, obtaining a continuous-time series.Two small glacial lakes without connection to the stream network (i.e. closed lakes) were investigated in the Schorfheide area, c. 70 km north of Berlin. Both are dominantly fed by groundwater and precipitation but differ in their hydrogeological and catchment characteristics. For one lake a c. 40 year-long gauging record is available, showing high lake levels in the 1980s followed by a lowering of c. 3 m till the mid-2000s. In both lakes submerged in situ tree remains were discovered and dated by dendrochronology, revealing low lake levels during the first half of the 20th century. One lake was almost completely dry until c. 1960. Aerial photos provided data on lake levels since the 1930s which are corroborated by evidence of topographic mapping. Combining the empiric data with retrograde lake-level modelling, a well-proven lake-level record can be established for one lake that covers the last c. 90 years. The same general lake-level dynamics could be reconstructed by means of proxy data for the other lake. In both cases climate has been the dominant driver of lake-level dynamics. Comparisons with other multi-decadal lake-level records from the region show that these differ, depending on the hydrological lake type which modifies water feeding and water level. The results clearly showed that lake levels exhibited substantial long-term changes that should be taken into account in future hydroclimatic and hydrological studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "The aim of this paper is to find major influencing factors of CO2 emissions from road traffic in urban areas. The approach of the study involved a statistical analysis on the basis of the formerly 23 urban districts of the German capital of Berlin. Correlation and regression analyses of empirical data from the settlement structure, the traffic structure and income have found that the number of jobs per district and the share of the well-off population can best describe the CO2 emissions from traffic in Berlin. Also the number of residents, the total built area, the number of cars and the amount of traffic area are positively related to the dependent variable. Therefore, the possibilities to reduce CO2 emissions from road traffic for urban planners seem limited: a restriction of space dedicated to traffic and a change of transport means for commuting represent leverage points, according to the analysis. The other significant indicators are less able to be influenced by local and regional decision-makers-an alteration in the means of mobility to less CO2 emitting alternatives is needed if CO2 emissions from road traffic are extensively to be decreased.\n",

      "Climate change scenarios predict losses of cold-adapted species from insular locations, such as middle high mountains at temperate latitudes, where alpine habitats extend for a few hundred meters above the timberline. However, there are very few studies following the fates of such species in the currently warming climate. We compared transect monitoring data on an alpine butterfly, Erebia epiphron (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) from summit elevations of two such alpine islands (above 1300 m) in the Jesenik Mts and Krkonose Mts, Czech Republic. We asked if population density, relative total population abundance and phenology recorded in the late 1990s (past) differs that recorded early in 2010s (present) and if the patterns are consistent in the two areas, which are separated by 150 km. We found that butterfly numbers recorded per transect walk decreased between the past and the present, but relative population abundances remained unchanged. This contradictory observation is due to an extension in the adult flight period, which currently begins ca 10 days earlier and lasts for longer, resulting in the same total abundances with less prominent peaks in abundance. We interpret this development as desynchronization of annual cohort development, which might be caused by milder winters with less predictable snow cover and more variable timing of larval diapause termination. Although both the Jesenik and Krkonose populations of E. epiphron are abundant enough to withstand such desynchronization, decreased synchronicity of annual cohort development may be detrimental for innumerable small populations of relic species in mountains across the globe.\n",

An examination of data from the National.

      "Capsule The Ring Ouzel in central Europe occurs in a mosaic of mountain forests and open areas.Aims To determine the habitat selection of the Ring Ouzel on a landscape scale in the western Carpathians. It was hypothesized that occurrence of the Ring Ouzel is associated with upper subalpine Carpathian forests and the presence of anthropogenic open habitats.Methods The study compared habitat characteristics of Ring Ouzel breeding areas and randomly selected control plots.Results The Ring Ouzel occurred between 685 and 1316 m asl, preferring middle and upper subalpine Carpathian forests. Significant differences between the Ring Ouzel breeding areas and randomly selected control plots were found for five of the landscape-scale habitat variables: altitude; distance to built-up areas; distance to roads; distance to small mountain meadows; and distance to clear-cut areas. A logistic regression model indicated that the important parameters influencing the occurrence of the Ring Ouzel were altitude and distance to the nearest clear-cut and small mountain meadow.Conclusion The Ring Ouzel preferred higher altitudes and the proximity of clear-cuts, which presumably are a physionomical substitute for the timberline and alpine meadows. However, this species avoids the presence of small mountain meadows, presumably because of succession of a dense layer of vegetation on former mountain pastures. The presence of a cultural landscape in the Carpathians may have allowed the Ring Ouzel to colonize the lower mountain areas.\n",

      "The relationships between climatic variables and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growth and needle dynamics were studied in three stands in Estonia and in four stands located near the northern timberline in Lapland. The trees sampled in Estonia had low correlations with the analysed climatic variables (air temperature, precipitation and indices of atmospheric circulation). Moreover, the weak cross-correlation of the time-series of the Estonian sample trees indicated that Scots pine is affected mainly by local factors in that region. In Lapland, however, height increment and needle production correlated strongly among trees within a stand (mean r=0.45 and 0.46, respectively) and between stands (r=0.32 and 0.37). Radial increment also showed a high inter-correlation among the trees within a stand in Lapland (r=0.45). Both height increment and needle production were strongly influenced by the temperature regime of the previous summer in Lapland (mean r=0.64 and 0.64, respectively). Radial increment was correlated with the mean July temperature of the current year (mean r=0.29). The correlations between the indices of atmospheric circulation and tree attributes were weak, while the strongest correlation was between the Ponta Delgada NAO index (PD-NAO) and height increment and needle production in Lapland. Height increment, needle production and radial increment have increased since the 1990s in the trees growing in Lapland. This may indicate a positive effect of climate warming on tree growth in Lapland. In Estonia, where climatic conditions do not limit tree growth, the climate warming seems not to directly influence the growth and needle dynamics of Scots pine.\n",

      "Pollen and plant-macrofossil data are presented for two lakes near the timberline in the Italian (Lago Basso, 2250 m) and Swiss Central Alps (Gouille Rion, 2343 m). The reforestation at both sites started at 9700-9500 BP with Pinus cembra, Larix decidua, and Betula. The timberline reached its highest elevation between 8700 and 5000 BP and retreated after 5000 BP, due to a mid-Holocene climatic change and increasing human impact since about 3500 BP (Bronze Age). The expansion of Picea abies at Lago Basso between ca. 7500 and 6200 BP was probably favored by cold phases accompanied by increased oceanicity, whereas in the area of Gouille Pion, where spruce expanded rather late (between 4500 and 3500 BP), human influence equally might have been important. The mass expansion of Alnus Viridis between ca. 5000 and 3500 BP probably can be related to bath climatic change and human activity at timberline.During the early and middle Holocene a series of timberline fluctuations is recorded as declines in pollen and macrofossil concentrations of the major tree species, and as increases in nonarboreal pollen in the pollen percentage diagram of Gouille Rion. Most of the periods of low timberline can be correlated by radiocarbon dating with climatic changes in the Alps as indicated by glacier advances in combination with palynological records, solifluction, and dendroclimatical data. Lago Basso and Gouille Rion are the only sites in the Alps showing complete palaeobotanical records of cold phases between 10,000 and 2000 BP with very good time control. The altitudinal range of the Holocene treeline fluctuations caused by climate most likely was not more than 100 to 150 m.A possible correlation of a cold period at ca. 7500-6500 BP (Miser oscillation) in the Alps is made with paleoecological data from North America and Scandinavia and a climatic signal in the GRIP ice core from central Greenland 8200 yr ago (ca. 7400 yr uncal. BP).\n",

      "The observed rapid glacier wastage in the European Alps during the past 20 years already has strong impacts on the natural environment (rock fall, lake formation) as well as on human activities (tourism, hydro-power production, etc.) and poses several new challenges also for glacier monitoring. With a further increase of global mean temperature in the future, it is likely that Alpine glaciers and the high-mountain environment as an entire system will further develop into a state of imbalance. Hence, the assessment of future glacier geometries is a valuable prerequisite for various impact studies. In order to calculate and Visualize in a consistent manner future glacier extent for a large number of individual glaciers (> 100) according to a given climate change scenario, we have developed an automated and simple but robust approach that is based on an empirical relationship between glacier size and the steady-state accumulation area ratio (AAR(0)) in the Alps. The model requires digital glacier outlines and a digital elevation model (DEM) only and calculates new glacier geometries from a given shift of the steady-state equilibrium line altitude (ELA(0)) by means of hypsographic modelling. We have calculated changes in number, area and volume for 3062 individual glacier units in Switzerland and applied six step changes in ELA(0) (from + 100 to + 600 in) combined with four different values of the AAR(0) (0.5, 0.6, 0.67, 0.75). For an AAR(0) of 0.6 and an ELA(0) rise of 200 in (400 in) we calculate a total area loss of -54% (-80%) and a corresponding volume loss of -50% (-78%) compared to the 1973 glacier extent. In combination with a geocoded satellite image, the future glacier outlines are also used for automated rendering of perspective visualisations. This is a very attractive tool for communicating research results to the general public. Our study is illustrated for a test site in the Upper Engadine (Switzerland), where landscape changes above timberline play an important role for the local economy. The model is seen as a first-step approach, where several parts can be (and should be) further developed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Biogeochemical models are often used for making projections of future carbon dynamics under scenarios of global change. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of the process-based biogeochemical model Biome-BGC for application in central European forests from the lowlands to upper treeline as a prerequisite for environmental impact assessments. We analyzed model behavior along an altitudinal gradient across the alpine treeline, which provided insights on the sensitivity of simulated average carbon pools to changes in environmental factors. A second set of tests included medium-term (30 years) simulations of carbon fluxes and a third set of tests focused on daily carbon Q water fluxes. Model results were compared to above-ground biomass measurements, leaf area index recordings as well as net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) measurements. The simulated medium-term forest growth agreed well with measured data. Also daily NEE fluxes were simulated adequately in most cases. Problems were detected when stimulating ecosystems close to the upper timberline (overestimation of measured growth and pool sizes), and when simulating daily AET fluxes (overestimation of measured fluxes). The results showed that future applications of Biome-BGC could benefit much from an improvement of model algorithms (e.g., the Q(10) model for respiration) as well as from a detailed analysis of the ecological significance of crucial parameters (e.g., the canopy water interception coefficient).\n",

      "A number of hydrological, botanical, macro- and micro-climatological processes are involved in the formation of patterned peatlands. La Grande Tsa at 2336 m a.s.l. is probably the highest bog in the central Swiss Alps and is unique in its pattern. In two of five pools there is in the contact zone between the basal peat and the overlying gyttja an unconfonnity in the depth-age models based on radiocarbon dates. Palynostratigraphies of cores from a ridge and a pool confirm the occurrence of an unconformity in the contact zone. We conclude that deepening of the pools results from decomposition of peat. The fact that the dated unconformities in the two pools and the unconfonnity in the ridge-core all fall within the Bronze Age suggest they were caused by events external to the bog. We hypothesize that early transhumance resulted in anthropogenic lowering of the timberline, which resulted in a reduction in the leaf-area index and evapotranspiration, and in higher water levels and thus pool formation.\n",

      "Muggelsee, a shallow eutrophic lake (Berlin, Germany), has been subject to global warming and concurrent reductions of anthropogenic nutrient loading during the past decades. Here, we focus on the recent increase in abundance of Dreissena polymorpha larvae. We aimed at ascertaining whether the change in abundance of larvae was driven by changes in climate, especially by climate warming, and/or by the concurrent changes in trophic state of the lake. Both the numbers of small, newly developed larvae and their lengths have increased in recent years, suggesting that conditions for overall reproductive success have improved. The timing of the increase in abundance of larvae was matched by changes in nutrient loading and phytoplankton biomass, induced by a reduced inflow of nutrients into the lake. Besides a correlation between the first appearance of larvae each year and the timing of the requisite temperature for first spawning (12 degrees C), no relationship between changes in water temperature and abundance, length and survival rates of larvae was found. However, a sudden drop in abundance of larvae in 2003 may be primarily attributed to low dissolved oxygen conditions during an unusually long period of stratification, induced by anomalous meteorological conditions. The increase in length and survival rates of larvae was most likely due to changes in food composition, which followed the decrease in nutrient availability, and to changes in the occurrence of planktivorous fish. The results suggest that the first appearance of larvae per year and the decline in abundance of larvae in 2003 were driven by climatic influences, while the overall increase in abundance and length of D. polymorpha larvae in Muggelsee was more likely caused by changes in the trophic state of the lake rather than by climate warming.\n",

      "The short-term effects of artificial warming on phenology, growth and leaf traits were investigated in four alpine shrubs using the open-top chamber (OTC) method in a timberline ecotone (3240 m a.s.l.) on the Eastern Tibetan Plateau. The OTC enhanced the mean air temperature by 2.9 degrees C throughout the growing season. In contrast, only a slight difference (0.4 degrees C) in the mean soil temperature was observed in the OTC compared with the control plots (CP). Spiraea mongolica, Potentilla fruticosa, Conicera hispida (deciduous shrubs) and Daphne retusa (evergreen shrub) showed earlier bud break, flowering and fruit coloring as well as longer flower longevity in the OTC than in the CP. All deciduous shrubs in the OTC had a longer leaf lifespan. Daphne retusa had higher leaf survival rates in the OTC. No significant differences in the total number of flowers and fruits were noticed for most species between the two treatments. Warming stimulated the shoot and leaf growth for most species. The specific leaf area tended to increase for many species in the OTC. However, the leaf nitrogen concentration tended to decrease in P. fruticosa and S. mongolica. The results obtained in the present study indicate that warming conditions can have strong impacts on alpine shrubs in a timberline ecotone.\n",

      "Livestock can contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and by increasing soil carbon sequestration. Packages of mitigation techniques can bring large environmental benefits as illustrated in six case studies modeled in the Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model developed by FAO. With feasible technical interventions in livestock production systems, the mitigation potential of each of the selected species, systems and regions ranges from 14 to 41 %. While comparably high mitigation potentials were estimated for ruminant and pig production systems in Asia, Latin America and Africa, large emission reductions can also be attained in dairy systems with already high levels of productivity, in OECD countries. Mitigation interventions can lead to a concomitant reduction in emissions and increase in production, contributing to food security. This is particularly the case for improved feeding practices and better health and herd management practices. Livestock systems also have a significant potential for sequestrating carbon in pasturelands and rangelands through improved management, as illustrated in two of the six case studies in this paper. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Chironomids and pollen were studied in a radiocarbon-dated sediment sequence obtained from a former lake near the Maloja Pass in the Central Swiss Alps (1865 m a.s.l.) to reconstruct the Lateglacial environment. Pollen assemblages imply a vegetation development around the Maloja Pass from shrub tundra at the beginning of the Allerod to coniferous forest during the early Holocene with a lowering of the timberline during the Younger Dryas. Chironomid assemblages are characterized by several abrupt shifts in dominant taxa through the Lateglacial. The occurrence of taxa able to survive hypoxia in the second part of the Allerod and during the Preboreal, and their disappearance at the onset of the Younger Dryas cold phase suggest summer thermal stratification and unfavourable hypolimnetic oxygen conditions in the palaeo-lake during the warmer periods of the Lateglacial interstadial and early Holocene. Mean July air temperatures were reconstructed using a chironomid-temperature transfer function from the Alpine region. The pattern of reconstructed temperature changes agrees well with the Greenland delta O-18 record and other Lateglacial temperature inferences from Central Europe. The inferred July temperatures of ca 10.0 degrees C during most of the Allerod were slightly lower than modern values (10.8 degrees C) and increased up to ca 11.7 degrees C (i.e., above present-day values) at the end of the Allerod. The first part of the Younger Dryas was colder (ca 8.8 degrees C) than the second part (ca 9.8 degrees C). During most of the Preboreal, the temperatures persisted within the limits of 13.5-14.5 degrees C (i.e., ca 3 degrees C above present-day values). The amplitudes of temperature changes at the Allerod-Younger Dryas-Preboreal transitions were ca 3.5-4.0 degrees C. The temperature reconstruction also shows three short-lived cooling events of ca 1.5-2.0 degrees C, which may be attributed to the centennial-scale Greenland Interstadial events GI-1d and GI-1b, and the Preboreal Oscillation.

      "The Central Balkan Mountain is one of the northernmost localities of the Baikan endemic Pinus peuce Griseb. After 1970 this species made an impressive invasion of the higher mountain slopes from the established timberline at 1760 m up to 2100 m a.s.l. The working hypothesis assumes a possible connection between this phenomenon and climate warming. Average annual temperatures in Bulgaria have marked no major change in the past decades as compared to a 100-year period of observation. After 1971 there was a recorded increase in winter month temperatures throughout the country. The same happened to climate in the studied region. There the trend consistently occurred in the coldest winter month of January. As compared to 1955-1974, in 1975-1998 average monthly, average minimum and average absolute minimum temperatures went up. The greatest increase however was in the minimum temperatures' most frequent value (the mode). Trees' age structure shows that the old timberline had stabilized and had nor changed until 1970. Pinus peuce's distribution at an altitude from 1770 to 2100 m is new and appeared after 1970. The species' invasion correlates with winter month temperature growth in the same period. Possible impact of biological and anthropogenic factors is discussed as well as the potential influence of indirect climate warming related changes (i.e. precipitation, snow cover). Evidence of the connection between these impacts and the observed phenomenon is deemed insufficient. Pinus peuce is defined as a good indicator of environment changes.\n",

We used automatically operated measurement chambers to monitor the CO(2) exchange of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) shoots in Finnish Lapland near the timberline over two growing seasons, yielding a total of 90 000 measurements. In this paper, we show that a recent ecophysiological model predicts the daily and seasonal pattern of photosynthesis with the unbiased percentages of explained variance of 90% and 92%, respectively, utilising temporally independent data. Our model combines the optimal stomatal control model of photosynthesis with a model of annual cycle of photosynthesis. The key feature for applications of the model is the temperature driven onset, acceleration and decline of photosynthesis. With these dynamics, the model provides a useful tool for analysing the effects of climate change on annual photosynthetic production in boreal conifers.\n",

An innovative framework for quantifying the combined governance of cities and energy systems is presented before focusing on a detailed study of London, Paris, Berlin and Copenhagen. By applying an optimization model to assess the lowest cost technology pathways to achieve emission reduction targets, the links between the governance of urban energy systems and the cost of achieving carbon targets are shown. Additionally a novel metric of scenario similarity is introduced in order to evaluate the difficulty of hypothesized energy system transitions. The results indicate that these tools can be valuable in identifying similar cities for the sharing of best practice, for performing comparative evaluations of energy transitions, and for reinforcing the need to complement quantitative assessments with a more holistic appreciation of local context.

      "Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. Ex. A. de. Juss. Müell-Arg.) is the prime source of natural rubber. Domestication of rubber began since 1876 with Wickham collecting 70,000 seeds from Upper Amazon and transported them to Kew Botanic Gardens. Somehow, rubber trees covering millions of hectares are believed to be derived from “22 seedlings” of Wickham’s original stock. Improving dry rubber yield is the exclusive and ultimate objective of Hevea breeding with consistent yield of 70 to 80 g/tree/tapping. Ultimately, in a small holding, a planter must gain an average yield of around 2200 to 2400 kg/ha from his stand (under optimal conditions), after accommodating tree-to-tree variations due to stock-scion interactions and soil heterogeneity. This is arduous, but achievable. Initial production of high-yielding clones gave 1600 kg/ha against 496 kg/ha of unselected seedlings. Adaptation and yielding potential of clones to specific environments are optimized through localized experimentation. Studies on adaptation of clones to new environments, especially to sub-optimal or marginal areas, are gaining momentum. As this extension happens, demand for new clones is on the rise. Possibilities of using rubber trees for reforestation, carbon sequestration and application of genomics in deriving climate resilient clones may come up in future, which breeders may have to take up with required priority. Five major methodologies followed are (a) primary clones and seed gardens, (b) derivation of recombinants and clone selection, (c) genetic analysis and variability management (d) early selection and estimation of genetic value and (e) application of genomics. Primary clones have immensely contributed in exploiting heterosis and production of new clones. For evaluation of recombinants, families are to be raised in closer spacing (2 or 3 m) and allowed to attain tappable girth for evaluation. While a normal breeding cycle takes 35 to 40 years, through skipping SSCTs and LSCTs, the scheme proposed can derive a clone in 17 years. Recent advances like transcriptome sequencing of bark and EST sequences generated from suppression subtractive hybridization-cDNA libraries could facilitate marker-assisted selection that could very well be used for selecting high-yielding genotypes at juvenile stage. Paternity identification can be done through breeding without breeding (BwB) in half-sibs and poly-cross (open pollinated) seedlings. Transcriptome studies have to come a long way to yield meaningful results to tag vivid genes responsible for QTLs, resistance and other quality traits, especially markers for cold/drought stress. It is opined that instead of subjecting plants for artificial cold/drought conditions, plants continuously exposed to such stress conditions must be used for analyses that can give a comprehensive indication of stress tolerance. The application of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technique to simultaneously discover and delineate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers is a robust and cost-effective approach for generating a common set of genome-wide SNP data suitable for constructing integrated linkage maps from multiple populations. Studies on mitochondrial and chloroplast DNAs are welcome steps towards understanding ATP efficiency of accessions that need to be augmented further, so that clones with higher ATP efficiency can be used for breeding. Such innovative techniques shall govern breeding Hevea rubber in the future, only when breeders and genomic specialists are working in tandem. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Combinational effects of elevated CO2 concentration and different temperature levels were studied on young Pinus sylvestris growing for three years in phytotron chambers and in the field (control). Five chambers were supplied with similar to 380 ('ambient air') and five With similar to 700 mumol mol(-1) CO2 ('elevated CO2'). Temperature levels in the chambers ranged in increments of 2 degreesC from -4 degreesC to +4 degreesC relative to the long-term monthly (day and night) air temperature mean levels in Berlin-Dahlem. Substrate was medium fertile and soil moisture and air humidity was kept constant.After three years of trials tree height was enhanced by 8% and stein diameter (2 cm above ground) by 7%. Response to CO2 was most obvious at the higher temperature levels (+2 degreesC, +4 degreesC). In total, temperature was less influential on biomass accumulation than CO2. Only the lowest temperature level (-4 degreesC) affected biomass accumulation negatively, whereas elevated CO 2 enhanced biomass of all plant compartments. Total tree biomass was increased by 30% at elevated CO2; the greatest statistically significant increase was found for 2-year-old stem sections (57.5%) and the smallest for the needle set from the last experimental year (23.2%). An optimum of enhancement by CO2 was achieved at -2 degreesC and at the level of the local long-term air temperature mean. Root/shoot ratio was by 20% higher at elevated CO2, mass of root collar/lower stem part ratio was increased by 43%. Allocation pattern of other parts were only slightly or not altered, neither by temperature nor CO2. Relative growth of cross sectional area (2 cm above ground) was not affected by the treatments significantly and wood density was not changed. There, the last year ring was 10% wider at elevated CO2 on average. Cell features were very slightly affected by elevated CO2: Only the cell area in earlywood tended to become larger at elevated CO2 (8%). Resin canal density was 43% higher at ambient than at elevated CO2, but wood ray density was not significantly changed by CO2. In the last two years of the experiment width of latewood cell walls declined by 11% and of earlywood cell walls by 13% with temperature increasing, to +4 degreesC above the Ion-term local mean. Cell area in latewood was 16% greater in the 3(rd) year at the lowest temperature level (4 degreesC). The ratio of cell wall area/total cell area in early- and latewood and the cell area of earlywood showed no statistically significant differences between the temperature levels. Comparing all data from the lowest (4 degreesC) and the highest (+4 degreesC) level, resin canal density was similar to29% higher in the 2(nd) and similar to 16% in the 3(rd) year. Wood ray density was not significantly affected by temperature.\n",

      "This research investigates whether abrupt changes indicative of a threshold response occurred in the spatial and temporal patterns of tree establishment within upper treeline ecotones in the Bighorn Mountains of north-central Wyoming, with a particular focus on assessing whether treeline advance occurred. Dendroecological techniques were used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal patterns of tree establishment at multiple spatial scales (local and landscape). Increases in the elevational extent of treeline and tree density above timberline were reconstructed for each decade of the 20th century. Regime-shift analysis was used to detect threshold changes in tree establishment. Marked increases in tree establishment and density occurred at local and landscape scales during the 20th century, particularly during the post-1970 period and in areas above timberline. Varying degrees of treeline advance occurred during this time, yet establishment upslope from timberline was often contingent on the availability of sheltered microsites in the lee of boulders. This highlights the importance of both broad-scale climate inputs and fine-scale site conditions in governing the rate and pattern of tree establishment in high-elevation treeline environments. Overall, the abrupt changes in tree establishment over time and space since 1970 suggest that bioclimatic thresholds can strongly influence ecotonal dynamics at upper treeline.\n",

      "The Ketzin pilot site, led by the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, is Europe's longest-operating on-shore CO2 storage site with the aim of increasing the understanding of geological storage of CO2 in saline aquifers. Located near Berlin, the Ketzin pilot site is an in situ laboratory for CO2 storage in an anticlinal structure in the Northeast German Basin. Starting research within the framework of the EU project CO2SINK in 2004, Ketzin is Germany's first CO2 storage site and fully in use since the injection began in June 2008. After 39 months of operation, about 53,000 tonnes of CO2 have been stored in 630-650 m deep sandstone units of the Upper Triassic Stuttgart Formation. An extensive monitoring program integrates geological, geophysical and geochemical investigations at Ketzin for a comprehensive characterization of the reservoir and the CO2 migration at various scales. Integrating a unique field and laboratory data set, both static geological modeling and dynamic simulations are regularly updated. The Ketzin project successfully demonstrates CO2 storage in a saline aquifer on a research scale. The results of monitoring and modeling can be summarized as follows: (1) Since the start of the CO2 injection in June 2008, the operation has been running reliably and safely. (2) Downhole pressure data prove correlation between the injection rate and the reservoir pressure and indicates the presence of an overall dynamic equilibrium within the reservoir. (3) The extensive geochemical and geophysical monitoring program is capable of detecting CO2 on different scales and gives no indication for any leakage. (4) Numerical simulations (history matching) are in good agreement with the monitoring results.\n",

      "Global temperature increase would seem likely to result in general upwards shifts of altitudinal margins of tree stands. However, range expansion of trees could be significantly affected by both negative and positive interactions with alpine shrubs in existing treeline ecotones. We examined the effects of dwarf pine (Pinus mugo) shrubs on the vegetative propagation and height growth of Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees in the treeline ecotone of the Hruby Jesenik Mountains, Czech Republic. Here, the non-native dwarf pine was planted above timberline during the 19th and 20th-centuries. In the treeline ecotone, vegetative propagation is important both for generation of clonal groups from seed-originated individuals and for persistence of such stands. We found that increasing density of dwarf pine stands strongly reduced vegetative propagation of spruce, as shown by the spruce clonal groups surrounded by dense pine having fewer layering branches and ramets than such groups outside pine stands. This has likely resulted from competitive pressure of pine causing decreased spruce layering mainly through mechanical damage and shading. In contrast, dense pine stands increased spruce height growth, presumably by providing shelter against wind and/or browsing. Our results indicate that interactions of prostrate dwarf pine and Norway spruce clonal groups include both competitive and facilitative components, which probably change in importance along climatic stress gradients.\n",

      "This paper provides a tentative reconstruction of environmental shifts in Europe associated with changes of the North Atlantic Current and related meridional sea-surface temperature (SST) gradients. During most of the Eemian interglacial (ca. 126-115 ka), the North Atlantic Current extended far north into the Nordic Seas and European environments were comparable to those of the Holocene. However, ca. 115 ka an SST drop in the Nordic Seas marked a southward displacement of the North Atlantic Current. This hydrographic shift was associated with substantial cooling in northern Europe and drier conditions in the Mediterranean region. The polar timberline retreated southward from 69degreesN in northernmost Scandinavia to 52degreesN in central Europe, and thermophillous deciduous trees became extinct north of the 48th parallel. Woodlands persisted in southern Europe for another 5 k.y. well into marine isotope substage 5d. These conditions indicate steep vegetation and climate gradients at the inception of the last glacial.\n",

      "Expected shifts in the upper forest limit of many mountain ranges due to anthropogenic climate change will likely be constrained by current and historical land-use practices. We used historical maps and Landsat satellite imagery to analyze timberline change for the entire Carpathian range in Eastern Europe. Our objectives were (1) to compare 19th and 20th century timberline elevations across regions differing in sociopolitical history and land-use trends; and (2) to quantify how land-use patterns and environmental influences were associated with changes in timberline position. Timberline changes across geopolitical regions were consistent with regional variations in re-settlement rates and population shifts following World War II. Important predictors for timberline rise were the mainly biophysical factors of slope steepness, timberline elevation, shrub cover, topographic curvature, aspect, and proximity to roads. For horizontal migration, important predictors were proximity to shepherd's huts, elevation, population density, forest composition, and shrub cover. Overall, cultural influences were critical for understanding the response of Carpathian timberlines to global change, yet biophysical influences proved important where reforestation was already occurring. In mountain ranges with prevalent agricultural abandonment, forest migration associated with climate warming may lead to increased contrast in the forest-alpine ecotone between areas with and without intensive land-use.\n",

      "Traditional assessment of heat-related health risks neglects the influence of the building physics as outdoor conditions are used as predictor variables. Data on heat-related mortality from Berlin, Germany and from the US are evaluated with a risk concept which differentiates between outdoor and indoor hazards. Such, the influence of non-linear building physics on heat-related risks can be considered and the impact of adaptation strategies can be examined.The number of heat-related deaths in the age-group 65+ for Berlin is expected to double with each 1 K increase in ambient temperature. It can be reduced by 50% with a mean ambient air-temperature reduction of 0.8 K. Countermeasures to urban heat islands are evaluated according to their reduction potential on hazards, both indoors and outdoors. The analysis shows that classic UHI countermeasures, which are effective in reducing air-temperatures outdoors, do not necessarily reduce the indoor hazard. Regarding indoor heat-related hazards, trees, facade and roof greening, cool roofs and cool pavements have a low impact only. Measures at the building level, namely cool roofs and facade greening perform best, however, passive cooling and air-conditioning are most effective. To reduce the number of excess deaths in a changing climate, combined measures are necessary. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Two hundred and sixty one newly measured tree-ring width and density series from living and dry-dead conifers from two timberline sites in the Spanish Pyrenees were compiled. Application of the regional curve standardization method for tree-ring detrending allowed the preservation of inter-annual to multi-centennial scale variability. The new density record correlates at 0.53 (0.68 in the higher frequency domain) with May-September maximum temperatures over the 1944-2005 period. Reconstructed warmth in the fourteenth to fifteenth and twentieth century is separated by a prolonged cooling from similar to 1450 to 1850. Six of the ten warmest decades fall into the twentieth century, whereas the remaining four are reconstructed for the 1360-1440 interval. Comparison with novel density-based summer temperature reconstructions from the Swiss Alps and northern Sweden indicates decadal to longer-term similarity between the Pyrenees and Alps, but disagreement with northern Sweden. Spatial field correlations with instrumental data support the regional differentiation of the proxy records. While twentieth century warmth is evident in the Alps and Pyrenees, recent temperatures in Scandinavia are relatively cold in comparison to earlier warmth centered around medieval times, similar to 1450, and the late eighteenth century. While coldest summers in the Alps and Pyrenees were in-phase with the Maunder and Dalton solar minima, lowest temperatures in Scandinavia occurred later at the onset of the twentieth century. However, fairly cold summers at the end of the fifteenth century, between similar to 1600-1700, and similar to 1820 were synchronized over Europe, and larger areas of the Northern Hemisphere.\n",

      "Tree-rings tell of past climates. To do so, tree-ring chronologies comprising numerous climate-sensitive living-tree and subfossil time-series need to be \"transferred\" into palaeoclimate estimates using transfer functions. The purpose of this study is to compare different types of transfer functions, especially linear and nonlinear algorithms. Accordingly, multiple linear regression (MLR), linear scaling (LSC) and artificial neural networks (ANN, nonlinear algorithm) were compared. Transfer functions were built using a regional tree-ring chronology and instrumental temperature observations from Lapland (northern Finland and Sweden). In addition, conventional MLR was compared with a hybrid model whereby climate was reconstructed separately for short-and long-period timescales prior to combining the bands of timescales into a single hybrid model. The fidelity of the different reconstructions was validated against instrumental climate data. The reconstructions by MLR and ANN showed reliable reconstruction capabilities over the instrumental period (AD 1802-1998). LCS failed to reach reasonable verification statistics and did not qualify as a reliable reconstruction: this was due mainly to exaggeration of the low-frequency climatic variance. Over this instrumental period, the reconstructed low-frequency amplitudes of climate variability were rather similar by MLR and ANN. Notably greater differences between the models were found over the actual reconstruction period (AD 802-1801). A marked temperature decline, as reconstructed by MLR, from the Medieval Warm Period (AD 931-1180) to the Little Ice Age (AD 1601-1850), was evident in all the models. This decline was approx. 0.5 degrees C as reconstructed by MLR. Different ANN based palaeotemperatures showed simultaneous cooling of 0.2 to 0.5 degrees C, depending on algorithm. The hybrid MLR did not seem to provide further benefit above conventional MLR in our sample. The robustness of the conventional MLR over the calibration, verification and reconstruction periods qualified it as a reasonable transfer function for our forest-limit (i.e., timberline) dataset. ANN appears a potential tool for other environments and/or proxies having more complex and noisier climatic relationships.\n",

      "The expansion of roads, and the subsequent changes to the surrounding landscape not only lead to landscape fragmentation but also have been shown to be a key driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Local declines of species abundance as well as changes in animal behaviour have drawn attention to wider ecosystem effects including altered species composition and a degradation of ecosystem functioning. However, methods for measuring and quantifying the distribution and environmental impacts of roads are not yet fully developed. We present a new technique for assessing the potential impacts of roads on biodiversity using a spatial road disturbance index (SPROADI). The index is calculated from three sub-indices: traffic intensity as a measure of traffic volume per time and space; vicinity impact, which is the assessment of edge effect of roads on adjacent habitats (the road-effect zone); and fragmentation grade, which provides an indication of the degree to which the landscape is intersected by roads. SPROADI was then tested using data from the Federal State of Brandenburg in north-eastern Germany. A sensitivity analysis was carried out on the results to assess the robustness of the index. The findings revealed expected patterns of high road disturbance in urban and peri-urban landscapes surrounding Berlin. Less obvious were the high levels of road density and impacts in forest plantations across the southern region of Brandenburg, and low levels of road disturbance in agricultural crop lands of the north-western region. Results were variable for areas under some form of protection. The only national park displayed substantially lower SPROADI values in contrast to the surrounding non-protected areas whilst other protected area categories, which were landscape conservation areas and nature parks, revealed SPROADI values that were equally high as those for non-protected areas. The results of this study demonstrate the strengths and potential applications of SPROADI as a quantitative means for identifying low-traffic areas in the context of conservation and sustainable transport planning.\n",

      "International environmental health studies of the past years have discussed the impacts of heat stress on human health. In particular, respiratory morbidity has shown significant heat effects in European cities. Metropolitan areas such as Berlin are characterised by an intra-urban spatial variability in socio-economic and bioclimatic conditions that is assumed to result in spatial differences in respiratory health risks. In essence, the elderly, children and people with chronic diseases suffer most from heat stress. A spatial epidemiological approach was chosen to map elevated risks for hospital admissions among > 64-year-olds with respiratory diseases (RD) during the summer months (June--September) from 2000 to 2009 and to link respiratory health risks to bioclimatic and socio-economic conditions in Berlin. The study aims to detect significant clusters with elevated relative risks for hospital admissions among > 64-year-olds with RD in due consideration of socio-economic conditions as a covariate for health outcomes. The findings from the purely spatial analysis show significant intra-urban disparities in the relative risks for hospital admissions among > 64-yearolds with RD. The highest relative risks within significant clusters were basically detected in the north-western and south-eastern city centre based on the study period 2000-2009 and also during the hot months of July and August in 2003 and 2006. The correlation analysis depicted significantly positive relationships between relative risks for hospital admissions among > 64-year-olds with RD and population density, socio-economic conditions and the annual mean number of days with heat loads on the basis of the period 1971-2000 and the average of the periods 1971-2000 and 2021-2050 at the zip code level in Berlin. To specifically implement health care intervention and prevention strategies into urban planning and to apply a directed practice of telemedicine for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, spatial epidemiological analyses are an important approach to identifying heat-vulnerable urban areas.\n",

      "The alpine timberline on Mt. Fuji (central Japan) is at 2,400-2,500 m above sea level. Over a 21-year period (1978-1999), we tracked changes in this vegetation boundary on a transect at a site impacted by the 1707 volcanic eruption. The timberline advanced rapidly upwards during this time period. Dominant tree species at the timberline (Alnus maximowiczii, Salix reinii, and Larix kaempferi) colonized sites that were initially largely free of vegetation at higher altitudes. Seedlings of L. kaempferi were particularly abundant at the border of advancing vegetation. According to tree age, we found that this was the first canopy species in the colonized areas. L. kaempferi is drought resistant, and this probably contributes to its establishment capability in the high-altitude climate. Most seedlings of Abies veitchii invaded patches of herbs and shrubs. These vegetation patches in the upper kampfzone provide important shelter for seedlings of invading tree species. We predict that the upward advance of the alpine timberline is a recovery process following the volcanic eruption, and that climate change may accelerate this advance.\n",

      "In northern to central Japan, alpine dwarf pine (Pinus pumila Regel) is a principal component of vegetation in the alpine life zone above the timberline. In this study, we examined interannual variations in the shoot elongation of P. pumila growing on the summits of six Japanese mountains and analysed the relationships between climatic factors and shoot growth during the period from 1980 to 2003.A significant increment of annual shoot elongation over the last 24 years was detected in three populations studied in central Japan, showing synchronization between the populations. However, such a trend was not found in the populations in northern Japan. In central Japan, interannual increasing trends in summer temperatures during the period were observed at meteorological stations near the populations. In the three populations of northern Japan, however, similar trends were not obvious, but a significant decreasing trend in summer sunshine duration was observed at a meteorological station located near the northernmost population. Summer sunshine duration, as well as summer temperature, was significantly positively correlated with shoot elongation of P. pumila in four out of six populations. We discuss these geographical variations in interannual shoot elongation of P. pumila between the six populations in relation to climate change in Japan.\n",

All individual standard chronologies and a regional well-replicated ring-width composite chronology (RC) show significantly positive correlations with mean summer (June-August) temperature. Herein mean summer temperature was reconstructed for southeast Tibet back to A. D. 1765 based on RC. This reconstruction successfully captures recent warming observed in the instrumental record since 1961 with the last decade being the warmest period in the past 242 years. It agrees in general with other temperature reconstructions of the Tibetan Plateau and extratropical northern hemisphere.

      "Crops of bean are sensible to climate changes, especially water stress. One way to minimize this instability is through genetic breeding of root system character. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify genotypes with superior root system in the first segregating generation at three depths in the soil profile and also verify the occurrence of heterosis for the root system character. Evaluations were performed using the method of Bohm (Methods studying root systems. Springer, Berlin 1979) at three different depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm), in the experimental area of the Institute of Molecular Genetics and Breeding, at the State University of Santa Catarina UDESC Lages-SC. Twelve segregating populations and four parents (BAF 09, BAF 07, BAF 50 and IPR Uirapuru) were assessed by comparison. The favorable genotypes to the progress of generations are: two, seven and three for depths up to 20 cm and three for depths up to 30 cm. The cross between the parents BAF 07 (black group) and BAF 50 (carioca group) presented wide genetic divergence, providing significant increase in the root system revealed by the analysis of their progenies. The selection of superior genotypes in the layer of 20-30 cm was limited because most genotypes have similar and poorly distribution. Due to the strong effect of the dominance component, heterosis occurred for root distribution in early generation. This fact may interfere in the selection of autogamous species of bean related to this genetic character.\n",

      "Forest growth and recruitment and their relationships to climate are complex. The aims of our study are (i) to examine the patterns in tree radial growth and recruitment along an altitudinal gradient in Mt. Everest region and (ii) to identify the climatic factors that are responsible to the observed patterns in tree growth and recruitment.Four plots, each 30 x 60 m in size, were established from the lower to upper limits of the eastern Himalayan fir forest in Dingjie County of the Mt. Everest Nature Reserve, China. Dendrochronological techniques were applied to obtain information about the radial growth and age of the trees in the plots. Correlation analysis was used to identify the relationships between radial growth and recruitment of trees and climatic variables, i.e. monthly mean temperature and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The population age structure was analyzed to investigate the recruitment history.The timberline plot was characterized by significant tree recruitments in the recent three decades and sporadic recruitments in earlier periods. The other three plots showed recruitment pulses during 1880-1910 in Plot 3 700 m, during 1870-80 and 1920-30 in Plot 3 520 m and during 1900-40 in Plot 3 410 m. The recruitment of fir trees in the timberline was sensitive to summer (June-September) temperatures, but it was mainly controlled by episodic disturbances in lower altitudes. Fir radial growth in the upper two plots was positively correlated with previous winter and current August temperature. Fir radial growth at the two lower plots was positively correlated with PDSI from previous September to current September.\n",

      "We describe the structure of two contrasting (elevation, topography, climate, vegetation, soil) alpine forest-pasture ecotones located in the Central Pyrenees (sites Ordesa, O, and Tesso, T). We define ecotone structure as the spatial distribution of trees of different size classes and growth-forms and the relationship between these aspects and the spatial distribution of understory vegetation and substrate. The studied ecotones are dominated by Pinus uncinata Ram. and have been little affected by anthropogenic disturbances (logging, grazing) during this century. One rectangular plot (30 x 140 m) was located within each site with its longest side parallel to the slope and encompassing treeline and timberline. The distribution of size and growth-form classes at site O followed a clear sequence of increasing size downslope from shrubby multistemmed krummholz individuals to bigger arborescent trees. At site O, regeneration was concentrated near the krummholz area and over rocky substrates. This suggests that krummholz may modify microenvironment conditions and increase seedling survival. At site T, regeneration was abundant above the treeline where the cover of the dominant understory shrub (Rhododendron ferrugineum) decreased. In both ecotones the diversity of plants was higher above the treeline than in the forest and decreased going downslope coinciding with the increase of P. uncinata cover. The reduction of plant diversity appeared above the current timberline. At site O, the decrease was steep and spatially heterogeneous what may be due in part to the edaphic heterogeneity. At site T the change was abrupt though smaller. The relationships between the plant community and tree regeneration should be taken into account in future ecological studies of treeline pattern.\n",

      "The effects of doubled ambient [CO2] and different temperature levels on young Pinus sylvestris growing in phytotron chambers were studied. Five chambers were supplied with similar to 380 ('ambient air') and five with similar to 700 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 ('elevated [CO2]'). Temperature levels in the chambers ranged in increment steps of 2A degrees C from -4A degrees C to +4A degrees C relative to the long-term monthly (day and night) average air temperature levels in Berlin-Dahlem. Substrate was medium fertile; soil moisture and air humidity were kept constant. After three vegetation periods twigs and stems were harvested, weighed, homogenized, and analyzed chemically. There was no significant temperature effect on wood mass accumulation, clearest positive [CO2] effect occurred in the youngest twigs. In total, wood mass increased by 28.5% at doubled ambient [CO2]. N-contents (percentage) decreased at elevated [CO2] in the uppermost stem sections and not in twig wood causing wider C/N ratios in total. In response to elevated temperature, N-contents decreased slightly in twigs (similar to 0.3%). Traces of free glucose, fructose and sucrose, which decreased from the top to the bottom, were found in stem wood, in contrast to traces of starch that increased from the top to the bottom. In response to elevated [CO2] only a little more (0.05%) was accumulated in the top shoot and in tendency; glucose, fructose, and sucrose contents were lower at the bottom of stems as compared to the control. There was no obvious response of these non-structural carbohydrates to elevated temperature except for starch that decreased to half of the content from the lowest to the highest temperature level. Among the hemicellulose compounds, rhamnose and arabinose declined from the top shoot to the bottom of stem, whereas 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic-acid, mannose, and xylose increased. Contents (percentage) of galactose remained approximately stable along the stem. The clearest positive effect of elevated [CO2] along the whole stem was found for mannose with differences of 0.6-0.3%. In contrast to rhamnose and arabinose that showed a negative response to elevated [CO2], mannose was reduced towards the uppermost stem sections. The 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic-acid was slightly lowered at the bottom, and galactose and xylose showed no [CO2] response. The only hemicellulose compound which reacted to temperature elevation was galactose. It increased slightly (similar to 0.1% per 1A degrees C). Cellulose and lignin (Klason) behaved oppositely: cellulose increased and lignin decreased from the top to the bottom. These structural components behaved reversely also in response to elevated [CO2]. In stem parts above the bottom section, cellulose content was slightly higher at elevated [CO2], and lignin content was slightly lower at the bottom. Lignin reacted to temperature elevation by a very slight increase on the average (similar to 0.1% per one 1A degrees C). Cellulose, however, decreased by similar to 0.2% per 1A degrees C temperature elevation. The importance of persistent sinks of carbon in woody plant parts is discussed in respect to the greenhouse effect.\n",

      "Energy systems in Germany and in all western OECD countries are currently undergoing transformations that have profound implications for their urban and regional governance, as well as for regional development in general. New technologies, regulatory regimes, management styles, marketing strategies and environmental priorities have emerged, dramatically reconfiguring patterns of governance within cities and regions. This is particularly obvious in the city region of Berlin, where utility restructuring coincides with a dramatic fiscal crisis in the city. The privatization of the energy utilities and of many public services, the opening of the regional energy markets, public and private climate protection initiatives and the emergence of new market participants are radically changing the conditions of regional governance and energy planning. However, although substantial recasting of policy issues and traditional forms of governance in the energy sector is underway in Berlin, energy management is confronted with severe institutional problems of interpolicy coordination and regional cooperation, entrepreneurial governance and contract management. Thus, this article argues in favour of new policy approaches and institutional reforms to shape the development of energy networks according to local and regional sustainability needs.\n",

Although trends such as climate change, socio-economic transformation and institutional change are global in their scope, they have very specific regional outcomes. Regionally distinct coping strategies are required which take into account both the diversity of regional impacts of global change and the local contexts of appropriate responses. This paper explores the impacts of global change on the management of water infrastructure systems in the Berlin-Brandenburg region in terms of three concurrent and overlapping challenges: climate change, socio-economic change and institutional change. It subsequently examines how regional actors in the water sector are addressing these three dimensions of global change.\n",

      "To obtain an estimate of the average temperature of the northern hemisphere during the last 1200 years, proxy data have been merged with instrumental recordings. These instrumental measurements are, with a few exceptions, only available for the recent 150 years. In the city of Berlin the temperature has been recorded since as early as 1701. However, during the first 150 years the measurements were problematic as location, measurement procedure and instruments changed frequently and without proper documentation. From 1847 onwards observations became more reliable once the Royal Prussian Meteorological Institute had been established. For the last 100 years temperature and precipitation measurements have been performed in parallel at Berlin-Dahlem and Potsdam. The datasets recorded in the city of Berlin and in Berlin-Dahlem have been merged to obtain a record of more than 300 years. It indicates that the temperature of Berlin has risen by 1.04 degrees C during the last 100 years after correcting for the urbanisation effect. In the same period, the total number of frost days has significantly decreased by almost 17 days, and the number of summer days has significantly increased by about 12 days. Annual mean precipitation has hardly changed (decrease less than 0.2 %) during the last century. However, rainfall has decreased by about 4 % in summer and increased by 3 % in winter. All precipitation changes are below the 95 % significance level. Model projections indicate that warming will continue which means that Berlin-Brandenburg will experience a temperature rise of about 3-3.5 degrees C by the end of this century for the IPCC scenario A1B. For the same scenario precipitation is expected to increase by 10-20 % in winter and to decrease by 10-30 % in summer: The seasonal precipitation changes compensate each other resulting in an almost unchanged annual mean.\n",

      "The recent Berlin conference on the changing atmosphere has highlighted two major problems: first, the planet's atmospheric chemistry is undergoing radical and potentially dangerous changes from the anthropomorphic emission of a variety of gases; and second, despite promises and treaty obligations, a number of countries (including the United States, Australia and Canada) are hindering efforts to stabilize these emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. An examination of the Canadian government's own data for carbon dioxide and methane emissions from energy sources indicates why the Canadian stabilization target cannot be met: gross emissions are increasing, per capita emissions are increasing, and emissions in terms of gross domestic product are showing minimal change.

      "The dynamics of agricultural and forestry biomass are highly sensitive to climate change, particularly in high latitude regions. Heilongjiang Province was selected as research area in North-east China. We explored the trend of regional climate warming and distribution feature of biomass resources, and then analyzed on the spatial relationship between climate factors and biomass resources. Net primary productivity (NPP) is one of the key indicators of vegetation productivity, and was simulated as base data to calculate the distribution of agricultural and forestry biomass. The results show that temperatures rose by up to 0.37 degrees C/10a from 1961 to 2013. Spatially, the variation of agricultural biomass per unit area changed from -1.93 to 5.85 t.km(-2).a(-1) during 2000-2013. More than 85% of farmland areas showed a positive relationship between agricultural biomass and precipitation. The results suggest that precipitation exerts an overwhelming climate influence on agricultural biomass. The mean density of forestry biomass varied from 10 to 30 t.km(-2). Temperature had a significant negative effect on forestry biomass in Lesser Khingan and northern Changbai Mountain, because increased temperature leads to decreased Rubisco activity and increased respiration in these areas. Precipitation had a significant positive relationship with forestry biomass in south-western Changbai Mountain, because this area had a warmer climate and stress from insufficient precipitation may induce xylem cavitation. Understanding the effects of climate factors on regional biomass resources is of great significance in improving environmental management and promoting sustainable development of further biomass resource use.

      "European beech (Fagus sylvatica) grows at the southern limit of its range in the mountain-Mediterranean vegetation belt up to the timberline. The southernmost beech forests of Sicily (southern Italy) show peculiar ecological, structural and silvicultural characteristics, growing in fragmented and isolated stands near the timberline and in topographically marginal unfavorable habitats. Past silvicultural practices increased the heterogeneity of stand structure at these sites. We compared stand structural characteristics and tree health in coppice-cut and control beech stands with respect to the local topographic gradient (bottom, slope and ridge) and canopy cover (clearing/border vs. interior trees). Our results clearly showed a correlation between declining tree health (crown and bark damage, higher percentage of dead trees and lower seedling density) and recent coppice-cuts, poor (marginal) site quality (on ridges and slopes) and reduced canopy cover (in clearing/border trees). The decrease of tree health indicate an increasing threat to the long-term viability of beech stands facing multiple environmental stress factors (such as those related to southern latitude and topographic position). Declining tree health in the control plots also supports this hypothesis. We concluded that traditional forest management practices, such as coppice-cuts applied regardless to the specific microenvironmental conditions, may pose a risk to beech forest health at the southernmost edge of the species' range.\n",

His work on the geological agency of the atmosphere informed his understanding of climate change and other terrestrial phenomena and led him to propose a new theory of the formation of the Earth and the solar system.Chamberlin's graduate seminar at the University of Chicago in 1896 contained all the themes that informed his research programme over the next three decades. These included the carbon dioxide theory of climate change in its relationship to diastrophism and oceanic circulation, the role of water vapour feedbacks in the climate system, and the relationship between multiple glaciations, the climate system, and the formation of the planet.

      "The alpha diversity of foliar fungal endophytes (FEs) in leaves of Betula ermanii in a subalpine timberline ecotone on Changbai Mountain, China increased with elevation. There were also significant differences in beta diversity along the elevation gradient. Among the environmental variables analysed, leaf carbon significantly increased with elevation, and was the most significant environmental factor that constrained the alpha and beta diversity in the FE communities. Tree height and the cellulose, lignin, and carbon/nitrogen ratio of the leaves also affected the FE assemblages. When controlled for the effects of elevation, leaf carbon was still the main driver of changes in evenness, Shannon diversity and FE community composition. The results offered clues of the carbon acquisition strategy of the foliar FEs across this cold terrain. There was strong multicollinearity between both annual precipitation and temperature, with elevation (|Pearson r|>0.986), so the effects of these climatic variables were impossible to separate; however, they may play key roles, and the direct effects of both warrant further investigation. As pioneer decomposers of leaf litter, variations in diversity and community composition of FE measured here may feedback and influence carbon cycling and dynamics in these forest ecosystems.\n",

      "A change in environmental conditions may result in altered soil microbial communities in alpine grasslands but the extent and direction of the change is largely unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate (i) differences in soil microbial communities across an elevation gradient of (sub)alpine grassland soils in the Swiss Alps, and (ii) the long-term effect of translocation of soil cores from a higher to a lower elevation site. The translocation of undisturbed soil cores from a high alpine site (2525 m asl) to a subalpine site near the timberline (1895 m asl) induced an effective artificial warming of 3.3 degrees C. We hypothesized that after longer than a decade, soil microbial community in translocated cores would differ from that at the original site but resemble the community at the new site. Results from soil phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis confirm significant differences in microbial communities between sites and a shift in total microbial biomass (TMB) and proportional distribution of structural groups in the translocated cores towards the lower elevation community. Patterns related to translocation were also observed as shifts in the fractional biomass of ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular fungi, and in relative contents of several structural groups. Hence, soil microbial community activity and diversity indicate a moderate shift towards new site conditions after 11 years and therefore, our data suggest slow responses of microbial communities to environmental changes in alpine soils.

      "We reconstructed decadal to centennial variability of maximum sea ice extent in the Western Nordic Seas for A.D. 1200-1997 using a combination of a regional tree-ring chronology from the timberline area in Fennoscandia and delta O-18 from the Lomonosovfonna ice core in Svalbard. The reconstruction successfully explained 59% of the variance in sea ice extent based on the calibration period 1864-1997. The significance of the reconstruction statistics (reduction of error, coefficient of efficiency) is computed for the first time against a realistic noise background. The twentieth century sustained the lowest sea ice extent values since A.D. 1200: low sea ice extent also occurred before (mid-seventeenth and mid-eighteenth centuries, early fifteenth and late thirteenth centuries), but these periods were in no case as persistent as in the twentieth century. Largest sea ice extent values occurred from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, during the Little Ice Age (LIA), with relatively smaller sea ice-covered area during the sixteenth century. Moderate sea ice extent occurred during thirteenth-fifteenth centuries. Reconstructed sea ice extent variability is dominated by decadal oscillations, frequently associated with decadal components of the North Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic Oscillation (NAO/AO), and multi-decadal lower frequency oscillations operating at similar to 50-120 year. Sea ice extent and NAO showed a non-stationary relationship during the observational period. The present low sea ice extent is unique over the last 800 years, and results from a decline started in late-nineteenth century after the LIA.\n",

      "Effects of temperature on growth and wood anatomy were studied in young European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) grown in 7-1 pots for 2.5 years in field-phytotron chambers supplied with an ambient (similar to 400 mu mol mol(-1)) or elevated (similar to 700 mu mol mol(-1)) carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]). Temperatures in the chambers ranged in increments of 2 degrees C from -4 degrees C to +4 degrees C relative to the long-term mean monthly (day and night) air temperature in Berlin-Dahlem. Soil was not fertilized and soil water and air humidity were kept constant. Data were evaluated by regression analysis.At final harvest, stem diameter was significantly greater at increased temperature (Delta 1 degrees C: 2.4%), sterns were taller (Delta 1 degrees C: 8.5%) and stem mass tree(-1) (Delta 1 degrees C: 10.9%) and leaf area tree(-1) (Delta 1 degrees C: 6.5%) were greater. Allocation pattern was slightly influenced by temperature: leaf mass ratio and leaf area ratio decreased with increasing temperature (Delta 1 degrees C: 2.3% and 2.2% respectively), whereas stem mass/total mass increased (Delta 1 degrees C: 2.1%). Elevated [CO2] enhanced height growth by 8.8% and decreased coarse root mass/total mass by 10.3% and root/shoot ratio by 11.7%. Additional carbon was mainly invested in aboveground growth. At final harvest a synergistic interaction between elevated [CO2] and temperature yielded trees that were 3.2% taller at -4 degrees C and 12.7% taller at +4 degrees C than trees in ambient [CO2].After 2.5 seasons, cross-sectional area of the oldest stem part was similar to 32% greater in the +4 degrees C treatment than in the -4 degrees C treatment, and in the last year similar to 67% more leaf area/unit tree ring area was produced in the highest temperature regime compared with the lowest. Elevated [CO2] decreased mean vessel area of the 120 largest vessels per mm(2) by 5.8%, causing a decrease in water conducting capacity. There was a positive interaction between temperature and elevated [CO2] for relative vessel area, which was similar to 38% higher at +4 degrees C than at -4 degrees C in elevated [CO2] compared with ambient [CO2], Overall, temperature had a greater effect on growth than [CO2], but elevated [CO2] caused quantitative changes in wood anatomy.\n",

Pine trees from sites at the altitudinal timberline of Khibiny Mountains show pronounced climatic signals in tree-ring width. We found a strong positive correlation with summer temperature of July-August (r = 0.58). The reconstruction shows lower summer temperatures from A.D. 1630 to 1840, a subsequent warming up to the mid-20th century and a cooling trend afterwards. According to our data, a temperature increase is observed during the past decade. The good coherence of multi-decadal to secular trends of our reconstruction and series of observed solar activity indicate that solar activity may have been one major driving factor of past climate on Kola Peninsula.\n",

      "The Sergyemla Mountains have unique timberline patterns. Abies georgei var. smithii (Viguie & Gaussen) and Juniperus saltuaria (Rehder & E. H. Wilson) dominate the north-facing and south-facing slopes of a U-shaped valley, respectively. Although these two timberlines represent the world's highest natural tree lines, little is known about the structure of their soil bacterial communities and the factors that control them. To characterize and compare the soil bacterial communities of two timberline ecotones with different spatial orientations, we investigated their structures by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing methods. We found that the structures of the soil bacterial communities differed significantly between the two opposite slopes, and the difference between the bacterial communities correlated primarily with soil carbon:nitrogen ratios. This probably relates to differences in the microclimate (mean soil temperature) between the two aspects in the world's highest timberline ecotones. In addition, the structures of soil bacterial communities also differed significantly with soil depth, and total nitrogen content had the greatest effect on the bacterial communities. In this region, soil temperature rather than mean annual precipitation has a major effect on the structures of soil bacterial communities. Microclimate differences (mainly differences in soil temperature) between the two opposite slopes might indicate that an amplitude increase of 2 degrees C in soil temperature could change the structures of soil bacterial communities by changing the status of soil carbon and nitrogen in these timberline ecotones.\n",

      "This investigation examines the relationships between atmospheric influences and the grain yield of spring cereals (spring barley, oats). Also, three yield components - crop density (ears/panicles m(-2)), number of kernels per ear/panicle and kernel weight - are considered. The study uses data of a long-term held experiment at Berlin-Dahlem for the period between 1962 and 1996.The results show that grain yields as well as the formation and differentiation of yield parameters are clearly influenced by weather fluctuations. Altogether it is possible to explain nearly 60% of the grain yield variability by meteorological variables for both species. The yield components are strongly influenced by weather in different months: the number of kernels per earl panicle in May during spikelet formation and development, the crop density in June during tiller reduction (declining number of tillers due to intraspecific competition effects), and, finally, the kernel weight in June and July during grain filling. Grain yields of spring barley are mainly influenced by crop density and number of kernels per ear, for the grain yield of oats, the most important component is the number of kernels per panicle, which depends highly on the weather conditions in May.

      "Even the most verbose declarations of intent solve no power policy problems or environmental issues. This is an experience now made by Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In late September 1996, the Chancellor made coal policy his very personal responsibility promising to establish preconditions for a ''live'' mining industry and protect core regions of the West German hard coal mining industry. At the UN Environmental Summit in Berlin in early spring of 1995, Chancellor Kohl promised that carbon dioxide emissions in the Federal Republic of Germany would be reduced by 25 percent between 1990 and 2005. However, in neither case has the Chancellor been able to fulfill his promises.In the meantime, both objectives have become highly doubtful. This is undermining trust in the Federal Government; in fact, nobody would maintain any longer that top politicians in Bonn enjoy any credibility if they Sail to meet binding promises. Both in the case of coal financing and in the case of CO2 reduction, massive backpedaling from the original promises is almost certain to follow.Should coal subsidies be decreased from a present level of DM 10 billion per annum to DM 2-3 billion per annum by the middle of the next decade and be phased out completely over the next ten to fifteen years, this would irrevocably mean opting out of the coal mining industry. It is not certain whether discussions with the Social Democratic Party about new nuclear waste management principles could provide more latitude in the field of coal subsidies. Without a sizable number of national coal mines there would be no possibility in Germany to demonstrate the reference plants needed to sell coal mining technology on the international market.As energy policy catering to the needs of Germany as a location of industry requires a mix of energy sources in which domestic coal and nuclear power play their roles. The use of nuclear power, which causes no CO2 emissions, at the same time could constitute a contribution to long term measures in the interests of climate protection. The Federal Government's objectives in protecting the climate cannot be discussed detached from energy policy decisions. Chancellor Kohl's promise to reduce CO2 emissions by 25%, i.e. 250 million tons, between 1990 and 2005 is jeopardized already without even taking credit of the savings achieved by electricity generation in nuclear power plants, to the tune of 150 million tons of CO2 annually, by adding this volume to the CO2 production in case nuclear reactors were to be decommissioned prematurely.Much more time is needed for a changeover involving relatively little friction. This is true both of the structural change in the German hard coal mining industry and of the switch to structures of production and consumption in the German national economy giving rise to less CO2.\n",

      "The Tibetan Plateau is the youngest and highest plateau on Earth, and its elevation reaches one-third of the height of the troposphere, with profound dynamic and thermal effects on atmospheric circulation and climate. The uplift of the Tibetan Plateau was an important factor of global climate change during the late Cenozoic and strongly influenced the development of the Asian monsoon system. However, there have been heated debates about the history and process of Tibetan Plateau uplift, especially the paleo-altimetry in different geological ages. Here we report a well-preserved skeleton of a 4.6 million-y-old three-toed horse (Hipparion zandaense) from the Zanda Basin, southwestern Tibet. Morphological features indicate that H. zandaense was a cursorial horse that lived in alpine steppe habitats. Because this open landscape would be situated above the timberline on the steep southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, the elevation of the Zanda Basin at 4.6 Ma was estimated to be similar to 4,000 m above sea level using an adjustment to the paleo-temperature in the middle Pliocene, as well as comparison with modern vegetation vertical zones. Thus, we conclude that the southwestern Tibetan Plateau achieved the present-day elevation in the mid-Pliocene.\n",

      "The altitude of timberlines in the central Apennines has lowered over the past few thousand years due to interacting natural and anthropogenic disturbances. These timberlines are usually sharp and consist of coppiced beech forests.We found scattered individuals of European black pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) at two high elevation sites above the timberline on limestone slopes. We investigated the spatial and temporal pattern expansion of black pine and assessed vigour and growth dynamics of pine trees.Over 250 individuals were mapped in the two sites using GPS. Several site and tree parameters were measured. Tree-ring widths and the frequency of intra-annual density fluctuations were also recorded.Black pine expansion started around 30 years ago. Pine trees are randomly distributed at higher elevations with no visible spatial pattern. Germination peaks were synchronous in the two sites, and tree growth displayed very similar chronologies, with synchronous occurrence of intra-annual density fluctuations.We hypothesise that the reduced livestock grazing over the last decades as well as climate warming are the major driving forces behind the high-altitude expansion of black pine on the central Apennines, where this species was present in pre-historic times.\n",

      "This paper investigates the promising proposal of Joint Implementation (JI) to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. This was ultimately the only concrete outcome of the Conference on Climate Change in Berlin, albeit restricted to a pilot phase. The basic idea, given the public's awareness of global warming, sounds economically plausible: The industrialized countries, the only ones required to stabilize and lower carbon emissions, can search for cheaper reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries and economies in transition. However, this proposal leads to strategic reactions by developing countries reinforced by the fact that this cheating coincides with the interest of the industrialized country. In short, this proposal will lead to cheating (given asymmetric information) and will thus produce largely faked reductions in emissions. On the constructive side, an efficient mechanism retaining the spirit of JI is derived, which deters strategic reactions. This differs from a usual principal-agent problem through an additional hierarchical layer: a global authority (e.g. the Conference of Parties on Climate Change), an industrialized country and a developing country. The unavoidable loss that is even associated with an optimal scheme due to strategic, behavioural reality (the first best optimum is unattainable, except at the top) leads, of course, to much less glamorous predictions in emission reductions. Moreover, the implicit subsidization scheme focuses and favours on already 'efficient' partners.\n",

      "Canada's Action Plan is the federal response to its international obligation under the UN Framework Convention of 1992 whereby Canada must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to the 1990 level by the year 2000. The Plan is failing completely, because of its essentially voluntary nature. Overall, greenhouse gas emissions will have increased 13 per cent in Canada between 1990 and 2000, four per cent more than the population increase for that period. Five other plans studied by government agencies are projected to fail to achieve the called-for reductions in emission. An analogous plan, the Rational Energy Plan, developed by a network of nongovernment organizations, is projected to enable the federal government to achieve its obligations under the Framework Convention and also its further obligations under the 1995 Berlin Mandate. This Plan has been analyzed using the government's own analytical tools which project that it will offer Canada substantial annual increases in employment for at least ten years, more prosperous households for more than ten years, and a smaller federal deficit for at least eight years. The federal government has no viable alternative to adopting this plan as soon as practicable. This paper explains some of the needed preliminaries to introducing the Plan, together with examples of tax-shifting and of easily implemented stick-and-carrot inducements to making the Plan work in a sea of partly hostile provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Newfoundland). The Plan will not be easy to implement because of necessary changes in human habits of thinking and attitudes. A new and simple strategy for reducing fuel wastage on highways is introduced in this paper; and also the concept of extended cogeneration, the Rational Energy Plan itself being a particularly fine example.\n",

Using a phenomenological approach, we use historical data to infer how an increase in air temperature has influenced a natural zooplankton community.2. Air temperatures in Berlin showed a significantly rising trend between 1975 and 1994. Mean winter air temperatures in the last 8 years always exceeded the long-term mean.3. A rising trend was also found for April water temperature, which increased significantly beginning in 1988-89. An increase of 2.58 degrees C in the last 21 years was recorded using a linear model. A significantly decreasing trend was found in June but no trend was noted for the other summer months.4. Phytoplankton composition shifted from a dominance of diatoms and cryptophytes during winter and spring in the 1980s towards a dominance of cyanobacteria in 1990-94.5. The dominant zooplankton species in spring shifted in recent years from the large-bodied Daphnia galeata to the smaller D. cucullata. Cyclops kolensis, previously the only invertebrate predator during winter, decreased in abundance while C. vicinus, usually present during spring and autumn, increased in abundance and was numerous during winter, a season passed in diapause in the earlier years.6. Because direct and indirect temperature effects are species specific, we put forward the hypothesis that zooplankton species, rather than functional groups, are the nexus between environmental stress, such as rising air temperatures, and ecosystem changes.\n",

      "The effects of the recent warming trend in many northern temperate lakes on the species composition of spring phytoplankton remain poorly understood, especially because a recent change in nutrients has complicated efforts, and previous studies have defined spring according to the calendar. We analysed data from 1979 to 2004 from Lake Muggelsee (Berlin, Germany), using physical and biological parameters to define the spring period. We show that a change in timing of spring plankton events in warm years led to the paradox of lower mean water temperatures during the growth period, favouring cold-adapted diatoms over cyanobacteria, and within the diatoms, some cold-adapted centric forms over pennate forms. Under high P : Si ratios, the increased time between phytoplankton and cladoceran peaks opened a loophole for filamentous cyanobacteria (Oscillatoriales) in warm years to establish dominance after the diatoms, which are silicate limited. Therefore, the warming trend promotes filamentous cyanobacteria, a well-known nuisance in eutrophic lakes, and surprisingly, cold-adapted diatoms.\n",

      "This paper presents a multi-proxy reconstruction of the climate change in Caotanhu wetland using pollen, phytolith and charcoal records, and the data of loss of ignition (LOI), grain size analysis, and susceptibility. Results reveal that between 4550 and 2500 cal. a BP, a dry climatic condition was not favorable for the accumulation of peat. Since 2500 cal. a BP, the climate became humid and the wetland developed with abundant freshwater aquatic plants, which contributed to peat accumulation. Nevertheless, alternate periods of rain and dry climate occurred during that period. Between 2500 and 1810 cal. a BP (550 BC-140 AD), the climate was more humid than at present. A lot of emerged plants, such as Phragmites, Typha and Sparganium, and freshwater green algae grew in the wetland which was surrounded by desert-steppe vegetation composed mainly of Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia, Compositae and Thalictrum. However, from 1810 to 1160 cal. a BP (140-790 AD), the water level started to decrease and hydrophyte species reduced greatly, but some Phragmites still grew in the wetland and around it was desert vegetation with high proportion of Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia. Then from 1160 to 650 a BP (790-1300 AD), it entered a period of desert-steppe with abundant mesic and xerophytic plants. And a lot of aquatic plants prevailed in the wetland. Here, what is noticeable is that percentages of arboreal pollen, consisting mainly of Betula and Picea, increased greatly and reached a maximal value of 27.2%, in which, Betula percentages rose to 23.2%. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that Betula grew in the highland of the wetland, or Picea timberline shifted downward resulting in the increase of percentages of Betula and Picea pollen, which were transported into the wetland by flood or wind. But since 650 cal. a BP, desert vegetation prevailed around the wetland again with dominant Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia, and the climate was similar to modern one. Despite some aquatic plants still growing in the wetland at that time, their amounts diminished greatly.\n",

      "Frost resistance and ice nucleation temperatures of leaves, from bud swelling until after full expansion, were measured in situ for five major woody timberline species with recently developed field freezing equipment. Frost resistance determined in situ on leaves of attached twigs was significantly higher than values determined on detached leaves in laboratory tests (e.g., the temperature at which incipient frost damage was observed (LT(i)) was 1.2 degreesC higher for detached leaves than for attached leaves of Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Frost resistance of leaves of all species changed significantly during shoot expansion (e.g., changes of 7.2 and 11 degreesC for Rhododendron ferrugineum L. and Larix decidua Mill., respectively). Expanding leaves (between 0 and 60% of full expansion) were the most sensitive to frost, with LTi values ranging from -3.4 degreesC in R. ferrugineum to -6.3 degreesC in L. decidua. Among the studied species, P. abies and R. ferrugineum were the most frost sensitive throughout the shoot elongation period. In situ freezing patterns of leaves of attached twigs also differed from those of leaves of excised twigs. During leaf expansion, two distinct freezing exotherms were always registered in situ. The first freezing event (E1, high-temperature exotherm) was recorded at -1.5 +/- 0.2 degreesC and reflected extracellular ice formation. Exposure of leaves to temperatures at which E1 occurred was, in all cases, noninjurious. The low-temperature exotherm (E2) mostly coincided with frost damage, except for some stages of leaf expansion in R. ferrugineum and P. abies, indicating that in situ freezing exotherms were not accurate estimators of frost damage in these species.\n",

      "Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (double-ambient CO2) on the growth and metabolism of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), fed on transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) (Bt) cotton [Cry1A(c)], grown in open-top chambers, were studied. Two levels of CO2 (ambient and double-ambient) and two cotton cultivars (non-transgenic Simian-3 and transgenic GK-12) were deployed in a completely randomized design with four treatment combinations, and the cotton bollworm was reared on each treatment simultaneously. Plants of both cotton cultivars had lower nitrogen and higher total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC), TNC:Nitrogen ratio, condensed tannin, and gossypol under elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 further resulted in a significant decrease in Bt toxin level in GK-12. The changes in chemical components in the host plants due to increased CO2 significantly affected the growth parameters of H. armigera. Both transgenic Bt cotton and elevated CO2 resulted in a reduced body mass, lower fecundity, decreased relative growth rate (RGR), and decreased mean relative growth rate in the bollworms. Larval life-span was significantly longer for H. armigera fed transgenic Bt cotton. Significantly reduced larval, pupal, and adult moth weights were observed in the bollworms fed elevated CO2-grown transgenic Bt cotton compared with those of bollworms reared on non-transgenic cotton, regardless of the CO2 level. The efficiency of conversion of ingested food and of digested food of the bollworm were significantly reduced when fed transgenic Bt cotton, but there was no significant CO2 or CO(2)x cotton cultivar interaction. Approximate digestibility of larvae reared on transgenic cotton grown in elevated CO2 was higher compared to that of larvae fed non-transgenic cotton grown at ambient CO2. The damage inflicted by cotton bollworm on cotton, regardless of the presence or absence of insecticidal genes, is predicted to be more serious under elevated CO2 conditions because of individual compensatory feeding on host plants caused by nitrogen deficiency.\n",

      "Moist savannas which include undifferentiated moist woodlands and savannas with abundant Isoberlinia doka and I. tomentosa (also known as Sudanian woodlands and Guinea-Congolian secondary grassland and wooded grassland) extend across West Africa up to the Central African Republic. Nitrogen stocks in the standing woody vegetation, litter and soil as well as the amounts of nitrogen transferred between these stocks and that lost through savanna burning of woodland and open moist savanna types are presented. Most of the total nitrogen is in the soil and then in the woody vegetation, with the least amount in the herbaceous vegetation. In a global change scenario characterized by elevated carbon dioxide levels and increased temperatures, it is predicted that there may be a reduced grass abundance and an increased woody species cover. However, human induced land use changes usually drastically reduce woody plant numbers. It is therefore predicted that forbs and low shrubs may dominate the future vegetation of moist savannas. The implications of such vegetation changes on nitrogen stocks are discussed.\n",

      "The 300-1000 hPa monthly average thickness data for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) published by the synoptic climatology group of the Free University of Berlin are analysed on a seasonally aggregated basis and with respect to regional variations.  It is shown that the rise in tropospheric temperatures between 1976 and 1990 began over the tropical oceans-when temperatures in the mid-latitudes were still falling-continued over continental areas of the mid-latitudes in the late 1970s, fell in the of the first half of the 1980s and continued again in the second half of the 1980s.  Temperatures over the mid-latitude oceans rose slowly in the late 1970s, fell in the early 1980s and rose strongly in the late 1980s.  High-latitude tropospheric temperatures showed no significant change throughout the period.In terms of seasonal variations, the largest warming relative to the late 1970s occurred over mid-latitude continents in winter.  However, compared with the base period used here, 1951-1960, the largest warming in absolute terms occurred over the low-latitude oceans in summer and autumn and over mid-latitude continents in spring.  Low-latitude warming was particularly strong over the Pacific Ocean.  There was some significant warming over mid-latitude continents in summer in the 1980s, which was of the same magnitude as the cooling in previous decades.  The high latitudes are generally still colder than during the 1950s even though there has been some warming there as well since the 1970s.  Around latitude 35-degrees-N, a ring of minimum warming appears in all seasons except winter.In the tropics, tropospheric warming is larger than surface warming; in the mid-latitudes it is of comparable magnitude and in the higher latitudes it is smaller than surface warming.\n",

      "With the signing of the Climate Convention at the UNCED in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 a first important step was made toward a coordinated climatic and environmental protection policy.  Germany is the host of the first Conference of Parties to be held in Berlin from 28 March to 7 April 1995.  It is the ambition of the German government to initiate concrete action at this conference.  These activities will be viewed in light of the fact that the government has committed itself, as a first step, to a tough 25-30% reduction in CO2 emissions for West Germany, and a reduction closer to 30% by 2005 relative to 1987 for all of Germany.  The impression is growing that the reduction target will be missed and that in many sectors of energy and transport policy decisions are being made that militate against climate and ecosystem protection even beyond 2005.  Whether there is cause for this concern is investigated in this paper.  On the basis of actual hard coal and brown coal policies as well as oil and gas developments, it will be shown what the likelihood is of meeting the CO2 reduction target by 2005.  Moreover, three policy scenarios of the Enquete-Commission of the German Parliament are used to show what the policy options are for meeting the German reduction goal.  This paper reaches a clear conclusion, namely that the government's energy and transport policies are not compatible with its CO2 reduction target, and hence its climate protection policy.  It is therefore necessary to alter the current policy.  Concrete recommendations are made.\n",

      "Biochar refers to carbon-based dusty residues obtained from biomass pyrolysis. This recently rediscovered traditional soil improver is currently being glorified for its wide portfolio of favorable environmental aspects. With its lifetime of several centuries, it is being widely accepted as a promising method of carbon sequestration. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that biochar can reduce bioavailability of some heavy metals and that it has a high adsorption capacity to persistent organic pollutants. These effects are explained by a complex of physical, chemical and biological mechanisms. Besides agriculture, it has been currently used in food and chemical industries, as well as in the building industry. Many other promising applications are under investigation. However, contrary to many enthusiastic proclamations, no revolution in agriculture or environmental management is taking place. Despite significant achievements in reduction of biochar production costs, high demand from the industry and energy sector keeps the biochar price still high, which prevents a return of the ancient farming practice on a commercial scale. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

      "Electric vehicles (EVs) provide a promising solution to rising CO2 emissions and, in the long term, the dependence on oil. In the present study, we examined how the current state of EV technology is perceived and accepted by a sample of early adopters and how experience influences the evaluation and acceptance of EVs. In a 6-month field trial, data from 79 participants who drove an EV in the Berlin metropolitan area were assessed at three data collection points (before receiving the EV, after 3 and 6 months of usage). Participants reported a wide range of advantages, but also barriers to acceptance. They perceive EVs positively and show positive attitudes towards EVs and possess moderate purchase intentions. Experience can significantly change the perception of EVs. Many advantages became even more salient (e.g., driving pleasure, low refueling costs) and several barriers (e.g., low noise) were less frequently mentioned. Experience had a significant positive effect on the general perception of EVs and the intention to recommend EVs to others, but not on attitudes and purchase intentions. Our findings reveal that EVs are already evaluated positively, but in order to achieve widespread market success in Germany, solutions are needed for important barriers like acquisition costs. Providing real-life experience could be a promising marketing strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "A high-resolution pollen record from Lago Trifoglietti in Calabria (southern Italy) provides new insights into the paleoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic changes which characterise the Holocene period in the southern Italy. The chronology is based on 11 AMS radiocarbon dates from terrestrial organic material. The Holocene history of the vegetation cover shows the persistence of an important and relatively stable Fagus forest present over that entire period, offering a rare example of a beech woodstand able to withstand climate changes for more than 11 000 yr. Probably in relation with early Holocene dry climate conditions which affected southern Italy, the Trifoglietti pollen record supports a southward delay in thermophyllous forest expansion dated to ca. 13 500 cal BP at Monticchio, ca. 11 000 cal BP at Trifoglietti, and finally ca. 9800 cal BP in Sicily. Regarding the human impact history, the Trifoglietti pollen record shows only poor imprints of agricultural activities and anthopogenic indicators, apart from those indicating pastoralism activities beneath forest cover. The selective exploitation of Abies appears to have been the strongest human impact on the Trifoglietti surroundings. On the basis of (1) a specific ratio between hygrophilous and terrestrial taxa, and (2) the Modern Analogue Technique, the pollen data collected at Lago Trifoglietti led to the establishment of two palaeoclimatic records tracing changes in (1) lake depth and (2) annual precipitation. On a millennial scale, these records give evidence of increasing moisture from ca. 11 000 to ca. 9400 cal BP and maximum humidity from ca. 9400 to ca. 6200 cal BP, prior to a general trend towards the drier climate conditions that have prevailed up to the present. In addition, several successive centennial-scale oscillations appear to have punctuated the entire Holocene. The identification of a cold dry event around 11 300 cal BP, responsible for a marked decline in timberline altitude and possibly equivalent to the PBO, remains to be confirmed by further investigations verifying both chronology and magnitude. Two cold and possibly drier Boreal oscillations developed at ca. 9800 and 9200 cal BP. At Trifoglietti, the 8.2 kyr event corresponds to the onset of cooler and drier climatic conditions which persisted until ca. 7500 cal BP. Finally, the second half of the Holocene was characterised by dry phases at ca. 6100-5200, 4400-3500, and 2500-1800 cal BP, alternating with more humid phases at ca. 5200-4400 and ca. 3500-2500 cal BP. Considered as a whole, these millennial-scale trends and centennial-scale climatic oscillations support contrasting patterns of palaeohydrological changes recognised between the north- and south-central Mediterranean.\n",

      "Eight tree-ring chronologies from coastal sites along the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) are used to develop a 227-year (1762-1988) reconstruction of spring/summer (March-September) coastal land temperatures for the region. This reconstruction explains 35% of the variance in the instrumental temperature data. The tree-ring records and reconstruction reflect the documented 1976 transition from cold to warm conditions in the North Pacific and are consistent with regional temperature compilations. Three of the eight ring-width series, from elevational timberline sites where trees are particularly stressed by temperature, extend back to A.D. 1600 and are used to identify additional occurrences of such transitions. The first principal component (PC) scores of these three longer records are positively correlated with spring (March-May) land and sea surface temperatures for the GOA region and are used to reconstruct land surface temperatures. Decadal-scale fluctuations in the reconstructions show agreement with decade-long changes in the intensity of the Aleutian Low pressure cell over the past century, suggesting that the tree-ring data may provide an index of past circulation changes for the northeast Pacific. Blackman-Tukey spectral analyses of both reconstructions indicate significant power at 7-11 years, with additional peaks at 3 years for the spring/summer reconstruction and 19 years for the longer spring temperature series. The modes of variation at about 3 and 7 years may correspond to those associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation bandwidth, whereas the 19-year term may relate to a proposed 20-year cycle of North Pacific circulation. The spring temperature series shows generally increased growth over the past century, coinciding with warmer spring temperatures in south coastal Alaska over this interval. Comparison with the entire spring series suggests that the recent warming exceeds temperature levels of prior centuries, extending back to A.D. 1600.\n",

      "Phosphorus (P) is a virtually finite nutrient element that cannot be substituted by any other substance. To overcome limited supply of mineral P deposits and to contribute to its sustainable management, abetter knowledge on P flows is needed. In this study, a substance flow analysis for P was conducted for the German region of Berlin-Brandenburg. The aim was to create a basis to improve P management in various societal sectors such as forestry, agriculture, human consumption, waste and wastewater management and urban soils. We found that within the system under study, agricultural soils showed the largest negative balance (-3617 t P), which was connected to low P fertilizer application and low livestock densities. Forest soils followed (-424 t P) possibly as compensating inputs by weathering and atmospheric deposition could not clearly be defined. From recent literature it was concluded that atmospheric deposition to soil pools has been overestimated in many P substance flow analyses and that forest productivity may become more P limited. The greatest P accumulations in soils were found in landfills (3492 t P) and urban soils (664 t P). The biggest flows came from agriculture, followed by human consumption. The efficiency of agricultural soils was high (127%), as reflected by a negative soil balance due to the low livestock density and input of mineral P. Agricultural soils were the largest contributor of P emissions to water bodies. For the region, evidence showed that weather variations were a major driver for P-removal by the main crops (50% range) influencing the overall P removal by about 46%. Based on climate change projections for the region, we discussed possible future implications for P flows of the region. The recovery efficiency of P from wastewater was very high (91.5%), but the recycling to agriculture was very low (11%), neglecting the large potential of P in wastewater. Also, the recycling of P into organic wastes has been hitherto insufficiently considered, as most organic wastes were not collected separately. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The gradients of soil physicochemical properties along mountain slopes and across climate-elevation gradients were studied in the Karkonosze Mountains, focusing on the human-impacted zonality of the vegetation cover. The main focus of the study was the environmental consequences, both human-induced and spontaneous, of vegetation changes in the mountains which may occur due to climate change. In soils developed from granite, a clear altitude-related differentiation of soil properties was manifested by: (i) an increase in total organic carbon (TOC) with elevation; (ii) an increase in exchangeable acidity and aluminum (Al-ex); (iii) a decrease in pH, (iv) a decrease in base saturation; and (v) finer soil texture and higher content of base cations in the foothills and lower slopes. These altitude-dependent trends have a threshold-type distribution, i.e. the values stabilize at 7501000 m a.s.l. or are reversed in the subalpine zone. Grass vegetation decreased TOC and Alex, but increased soil pH and base saturation compared with forest vegetation at the same altitude zone. Soils under spruce had higher TOC but lower pH compared with beech stands.Present-day changes of mountain area management in Central Europe, i.e. the replacement of spruce monocultures with beech or mixed stands in the lower forest zone and reforestation (mainly with spruce or mountain pine) of abandoned meadows and pastures at and above the timberline significantly influence topsoil properties, but there is a contrasting direction of changes in the lower and upper altitude zones. Expected climate changes may shift the upper limits of the individual forest zones and reinforce the ongoing changes in forest management. The final regional result of changes is difficult to calculate and strongly dependent on the degree of anthropogenic transformation of vegetation cover. However, both the current changes in management practices and possible climate changes will reinforce the existing vertical gradients of mountain soil properties, including the elevation-related increase in TOC, exchangeable acidity and Alex, as well as the decrease in soil pH and base saturation.

      "Recent evidence from novel phytotron and free-air ozone (O(3)) fumigation experiments in Europe and America on forest tree species is highlighted in relation to previous chamber studies. Differences in O(3) sensitivity between pioneer and climax species are examined and viewed for trees growing at the harsh alpine timberline ecotone. As O(3) apparently counteracts positive effects of elevated CO(2) and mitigates productivity increases, response is governed by genotype, competitors, and ontogeny rather than species per se. Complexity in O(3) responsiveness increased under the influence of pathogens and herbivores. The new evidence does not conflict in principle with previous findings that, however, pointed to a low ecological significance. This new knowledge on trees' O(3) responsiveness beyond the juvenile stage in plantations and forests nevertheless implies limited predictability due to complexity in biotic and abiotic interactions. Unravelling underlying mechanisms is mandatory for assessing O(3) risks as an important component of climate change scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The present article reports on the results and interpretation of a total of 235 radiocarbon dates from Alpine sites in the Otztal region. Out of these, 88 age determinations were performed on equipment and artifacts associated with the Neolithic Iceman (discovered in 1991), and on a variety of plant and animal specimens collected at his discovery site. Since the material was dispersed over a larger area, C-14 dates were important to establish the deposition time of the respective samples. About half of the samples fall into the time period where the Iceman lived, documenting synchronous deposition, whereas the others spread out over several thousand years before and after his lifetime. The other set of samples (147) were collected along the Otztal Valley to the north, with a few samples collected also south of the Alpine watershed. The samples were mainly from soil profiles and peat bogs above the present-day timberline. Overall, the analysis of the data indicates human presence in these high regions of the Alps throughout the Holocene. While the older botanical and archaeological finds indicate activities of hunting and foraging, the younger ones (after similar to 5000 BC) point to an intensification of pasturing. This suggests that early human activity was concentrated at altitudes where natural pastures were found, which were probably more favorable than locations at the bottom of the valleys where flooding and other hazards existed. Early users may have come from south of the water divide spreading into the northern regions, particularly during the summer season. It is possible that the Iceman perished at one of his crossings over the probably well-known high-altitude mountain pass due to reasons not yet fully resolved.\n",

      "The beginnings of the continuous human presence and of pastoral activities in the high mountainous region of Central Europe have recently become a frequently discussed topic in both archaeology and palaeoecology. In extreme environments such as the high Alpine main ridge and adjacent areas, highly adaptive subsistence strategies were required to exploit natural resources available in the subalpine and alpine zones. Such strategies were determined by changing environmental, social, and economic conditions. To investigate the relationships between settlement dynamics, human impact, and Holocene climatic changes, we studied the valleys of the Silvretta Massif in the central Eastern Alps between the Paznaun (Austria) and Lower Engadine valleys (Switzerland). We are presenting new archaeological, palaeoecological, and pedological evidence of continuous human activities from the Early Neolithic Period to the Bronze Age (similar to 5,500-800 BC). This evidence sheds new light on the beginnings of intensified human impact on the high mountainous landscape, i.e. activities beyond Mesolithic hunting along the timberline. Archaeological data suggest a shift in subsistence strategies from hunting to herding at the end of the Neolithic Period (similar to 2,800-2,500 BC). While palaeoecological data confirm this trend, they also indicate potentially earlier human and livestock impact through forest clearances by fire and grazing from about 4,200 BC onwards. In addition to archaeological sites and peat bogs, soils in high-altitude regions prove to be appropriate archives indicating former vegetation cover, shifts of timberline altitudes as well as disturbance of soil formation by human activity such as by slash-and-burn and by livestock grazing.\n",

      "We used the soil-core translocation method to investigate the effect of increased temperature on above- and below-ground phytomass and organic matter in cool alpine areas. The translocation of undisturbed soil cores from a high alpine site (2525 m a.s.l.) to an alpine site near the timberline (1895 m a.s.l.) achieved an effective artificial warming of 3.3 K. From a methodological point of view, the translocation of soil cores was performed successfully. Soil cores moved to a new site at the same altitude showed no change in above- and below-ground vegetation, bulk density, and soil skeleton. At both sites, soils were Haplic Podzols with a similar chemistry and clay mineralogy. At the lower elevation site, however, podzolization processes seemed to be more pronounced. As a consequence, the translocation of the soil cores probably led to a disturbance of the actual steady state that had been established after about 10,000-13,000 years of soil formation. This might have affected the adaptability of the vegetation system. Therefore, it cannot be fully excluded that the experimental design influenced the results. Translocation of soil cores from a very cool to a warmer site led to a distinct decrease in above-ground phytomass (about -45%) over the experimental period of two years. Below-ground phytomass significantly decreased (up to -50%) in the topsoil (0-5 cm) after artificial warming. Possible mechanisms are that roots reduced photosynthesis and hence C flow below-ground, a reduction of soil moisture that would have led to root death (not a very probable cause, however) or an abrupt change in the radiation duration and flux which affected root growth (also not very probable). Fast climate change exceeded the ability of the above-ground and below-ground phytomass to adapt quickly. Whether the decrease in phytomass was a short-term or a long-term response to climate warming remains uncertain. Based on a gradient study (climosequence at the same locality), we hypothesize that the decreased plant productivity might be a short-term effect.\n",

      "The relationship between climate change and the dynamics of ecotonal populations of mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana [Bong.] Carr.) was determined by comparing climate and the age structure of trees from 24 plots and seedlings from 13 plots in the subalpine zone of Lassen Volcanic National Park, California. Tree establishment was greatest during periods with above normal annual and summer temperatures, and normal or above normal precipitation. Seedling establishment was positively correlated with above normal annual and summer temperatures and negatively correlated with April snowpack depth. The different responses of trees and seedlings to precipitation variation is probably related to site soil moisture conditions. Mountain hemlock populations began to expand in 1842 and establishment increased dramatically after 1880 and peaked during a warm mesic period between 1895 and 1910. The onset of forest expansion coincides with warming that began at the end of the Little Ice Age (1850-1880). These data indicate that stability of the mountain hemlock ecotone is strongly influenced by climate. If warming induced by greenhouse,eases does occur as climate models predict, then the structure and dynamics of near timberline forests in the Pacific Northwest will change.\n",

      "The climate change debate has increased the need for knowledge on both long- and short-term regional environmental changes. In general, these changes may often be a product of multiple causes, which complicates the separation of single driving forces. In this review we focus on current water budget changes in Germany's capital region, Berlin-Brandenburg, over the last 30 years. Available studies from a variety of disciplines (e.g. hydrology, water engineering, landscape ecology, nature conservation) were analysed in order to (1) identify both local and regional hydrological changes, (2) reveal their potential causes, and (3) discuss responses of ecosystems and society. These studies show that the Berlin-Brandenburg region is widely characterised by decreasing groundwater recharge, leading to decreasing groundwater and lake levels as well as decreasing fluvial discharge. These trends result both from complex, regional human impacts (e.g. long-term effects of hydro-melioration and changes in forest composition) and more general climate warming. The observed and assumed (future) changes of the regional water balance have been creating, and will continue to create, multifaceted impacts on existing ecosystems and society (e.g. wetland drying, decrease of biodiversity, decrease of productivity of grasslands and forests, increasing conflicts of interests). Several efforts to respond to the regional water deficit problem have already been undertaken, comprising for instance land-use optimisation, wetland restoration measures and the reestablishment of mixed deciduous forests. In general, however, the reviewed regional material on this topic reveals that the number and complexity of empirical studies are still poor. Thus, for both the identification and the explanation of current water balance changes and their effects, as well as for development and implementation of adaptive strategies, further multidisciplinary research efforts at different scales, including interregional comparisons, are required. Furthermore, both the observation of hydrological changes and the evaluation of adaptive and mitigative responses require at least continuous or, even better, extended monitoring efforts.\n",

      "At the landscape scale, the response of alpine treelines to increasing temperatures often varies due to second-order factors such as terrain properties, vegetation structure, and land use. In this study, we examined the influence of topographic and vegetation-structure variables on spatial patterns of treeline ecotone shifts in the Sudetes Mountains (Czech Republic). The changing positions of the alpine timberline and alpine treeline were determined from orthogonal aerial images allowing comparisons between 1936 and 2005. Our results showed that the alpine timberline advanced upward at an overall rate between 0.30 m yr-1 in the Hruby Jesenik Mountains (eastern part of the Sudetes) and 0.43 m yr(-1) in the Giant Mountains (western part of the Sudetes). Forest infilling was substantially greater than advances above original alpine treeline positions. Forest upward shifts occurred mostly on sites with already established, well-dispersed trees and low levels of prostrate dwarf pine cover. Topographic variables such as altitude and heat load affected forest advance if initial tree cover was low. The occurrence of competitive prostrate shrubs and the presence of climatically extreme convex parts of slopes appear to be important secondorder factors affecting treeline ecotone shifts, particularly at wind-affected treelines.\n",
